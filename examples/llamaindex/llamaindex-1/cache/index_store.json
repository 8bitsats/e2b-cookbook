To begin your study of the life of Muad‘Dib, then, take\r\ncare that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year\r\nof the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most\r\nspecial care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet\r\nArrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was bom on\r\nCaladan and lived his first fifteen years there.

It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that\r\nhad served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that\r\ncooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by\r\nPaul’s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in\r\nhis bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor,\r\nthe awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one\r\nstep ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like\r\nmatted spiderwebs, hooded ’round darkness of features, eyes like glittering\r\njewels. “Is he not small for his age, Jessica? ” the old woman asked. Her voice\r\nwheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul’s mother answered in her soft contralto: “The Atreides are known to\r\nstart late getting their growth, Your Reverence. ”\r\n“So I’ve heard, so I’ve heard,” wheezed the old woman. “Yet he’s already\r\nfifteen. ”\r\n“Yes, Your Reverence. ”\r\n“He’s awake and listening to us,” said the old woman. “Sly little rascal. ”\r\nShe chuckled.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RxcF3xcDedyozMOuqap67a+Sv8HYRuE0GJMWT3TgTP0="},"3daf98d7-3b9b-44b2-937b-588a4cb8d527":{"id_":"3daf98d7-3b9b-44b2-937b-588a4cb8d527","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"aKutYMRoqYZe8ih5shFV2497Oj/WaQLjduuPG0C3N08="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"17843c8f-6abb-4b10-a917-ff8154111a85","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"RxcF3xcDedyozMOuqap67a+Sv8HYRuE0GJMWT3TgTP0="}},"text":"“Sly little rascal. ”\r\nShe chuckled. “But royalty has need of slyness.

Paul lay awake wondering: What’s a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest\r\nthing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench\r\ninstead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke’s concubine and\r\nmother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he\r\nwondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gomjabbar... Kwisatz Haderach. There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so\r\ndifferent from Caladan that Paul’s mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Thufir Hawat, his father’s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their\r\nmortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding\r\nthe planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the\r\ngeriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by\r\nthe House of Atreides in fief-complete-an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the\r\nDuke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. “A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,” Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around\r\nhim moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a\r\ncathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even\r\nwhile he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon\r\nawakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking.

Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body\r\nlessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the\r\nresponses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be\r\nconscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload\r\nregions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the\r\nidea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not\r\nproduce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the\r\nperceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his\r\nuniverse ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily\r\nintegrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell\r\nneeds ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-\r\npermanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul’s floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul’s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it\r\nthrough closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and\r\nhurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom\r\nceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze\r\nheld with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes\r\nstaring solemnly. “You’re awake,” she said. “Did you sleep well? ”\r\n“Yes. ”\r\nHe studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as\r\nshe chose clothing for him from the closet racks.

The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. “You did that on\r\nremarkably few clues,” she said. “Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit\r\nschool was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in\r\nhuman affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating\r\nhuman stock from animal stock—for breeding purposes. ”\r\nThe old woman’s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul.

Hawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I’m doing it, getting across to him the\r\nimportance of this planet as an enemy. It’s madness to go in there without\r\nthat caution in our minds. Paul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the\r\nspreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. “Water,” he said. “You’ll learn a great concern for water,” Hawat said. “As the Duke’s son\r\nyou’ll never want for it, but you’ll see the pressures of thirst all around you. ”\r\nPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and\r\nthe ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about\r\nwater starvation. “You’ll learn about the funeral plains,” she’d said, “about the wilderness\r\nthat is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the\r\nsandworms. You’ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will\r\nmean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You’ll ride upon your\r\nown two feet without ‘thopter or groundcar or mount. ”\r\nAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone—singsong and wavering—\r\nthan by her words. “When you live upon Arrakis,” she had said, “khala, the land is empty. The\r\nmoons will be your friends, the sun your enemy. ”\r\nPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post\r\nguarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: “Do\r\nyou see no hope, Your Reverence? ”\r\n“Not for the father. ” And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence,\r\nlooked down at Paul.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Tg2BDHrpncXtKMmvQSUSqFjOdg3bM+4dtvDBI8yTO8M="},"9bf9a194-9214-43f9-b52c-b76fbba9695a":{"id_":"9bf9a194-9214-43f9-b52c-b76fbba9695a","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_38","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"ncdJ4UuOvLoqLEx/6Z/toSKq/y78aONsBr1fv4f9LhU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"999262ec-a22f-41b3-8542-45d27fe25918","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"Tg2BDHrpncXtKMmvQSUSqFjOdg3bM+4dtvDBI8yTO8M="}},"text":"” And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence,\r\nlooked down at Paul. “Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported\r\nby four things.... ” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “... the learning of\r\nthe wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of\r\nthe brave.

One more\r\nday here, he thought. He looked around the room. We’re leaving. The idea of\r\ndeparture was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He\r\nrecalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of\r\nmany things—the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides,\r\nthe suns—the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any\r\nsense of the now.

Halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up—the\r\nrapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile\r\nacross the room. “So you don’t even have a good morning for me, you young imp,” Halleck\r\nsaid. “And what barb did you sink in old Hawat?

He\r\nlifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. “This in the hand of an\r\nenemy can let out your life’s blood! You’re an apt pupil, none better, but I’ve\r\nwarned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with\r\ndeath in his hand. ”\r\n“I guess I’m not in the mood for it today,” Paul said. “Mood? ” Halleck’s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield’s\r\nfiltering. “What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises\r\n—no matter the mood! Mood’s a thing for cattle or making love or playing\r\nthe baliset. It’s not for fighting. ”\r\n“I’m sorry, Gurney. ”\r\n“You’re not sorry enough! ”\r\nHalleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left\r\nhand, the rapier poised high in his right. “Now I say guard yourself for true! ”\r\nHe leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack. Paul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges touched\r\nand repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his\r\nskin. What’s gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He’s not faking this!

Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark\r\nsheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took\r\nsheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held\r\nit up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was\r\ndouble-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters\r\nlong. “Do you know this, my Lady? ” Mapes asked. It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis,\r\nthe blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by\r\nrumor and wild gossip. “It’s a crysknife,” she said. “Say it not lightly,” Mapes said. “Do you know its meaning? ”\r\nAnd Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here’s the\r\nreason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My\r\nanswer could precipitate violence or ... what? She seeks an answer from me:\r\nthe meaning of a knife. She’s called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that’s “Death Maker” in Chakobsa. She’s getting restive. I must\r\nanswer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Jessica said: “It’s a maker—”\r\n“Eighe-e-e-e-e-e! ” Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection\r\nshooting around the room. Jessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of\r\ndeath and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the\r\ndeep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle\r\ntwitch. The key word was ... maker. Maker? Maker. Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.

Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression. “Do you know what they’re thinking? ” Yueh asked. “You profess to read minds? ” she asked. “Those minds,” he said. “They look at those trees and they think: ‘There\r\nare one hundred of us. ’ That’s what they think. ”\r\nShe turned a puzzled frown on him. “Why? ”\r\n“Those are date palms,” he said. “One date palm requires forty liters of\r\nwater a day.

Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read\r\nand remain in the other room. Now was the moment to go exploring. Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into\r\nthe closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard\r\nof the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul\r\nfroze, and immobility saved his life. From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five\r\ncentimeters long. Paul recognized it at once—a common assassination\r\nweapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a\r\nravening sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could\r\nburrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest\r\nvital organ. The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back. Through Paul’s mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker\r\nlimitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the room to reflect his\r\ntarget, the operator would be relying on motion—anything that moved. A\r\nshield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his\r\nshield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were\r\nexpensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance—and there was always the\r\nperil of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The\r\nAtreides relied on their body shields and their wits. Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only\r\nhis wits to meet this threat. The hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted\r\nlight from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room. I must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery\r\non the bottom. I must grip tightly.

I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down\r\nthe hall. ” She pointed to her right. “Your father’s men are still waiting. ”\r\nThose will be Hawat’s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this\r\nthing. “Go to my father’s men,” he said. “Tell them I’ve caught a hunter-seeker\r\nin the house and they’re to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal\r\noff the house and its grounds immediately. They’ll know how to go about it. The operator’s sure to be a stranger among us. ”\r\nAnd he wondered: Could it be this creature?

From the top of the mountain, you can\r\nnot see the mountain. ”\r\n—from “Muad’Dib: Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan\r\nAT THE end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to\r\nan oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door. Oval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house. Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white\r\nsun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the\r\nhall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out\r\nbits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps. Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her\r\nsliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a\r\nfaint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been. Surely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one\r\nindividual’s hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And\r\nthere were ways to open any palm lock—as she had learned at school. Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm\r\nagainst the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the\r\nlines—a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the\r\nsurface. She felt the click. But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her\r\nhand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs. “There are men in the great hall say they’ve been sent by the Duke to get\r\nyoung master Paul,” Mapes said. “They’ve the ducal signet and the guard has\r\nidentified them. ” She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.

Someone probably knocked the\r\nprop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm\r\nlock. She stepped over the lip into the little room. Why an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of\r\nexotic creatures sealed off in special climates. Special climate! That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet\r\ngrowing things had to be irrigated. The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it\r\nopen securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-\r\nlocked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above\r\nthe handle. She recognized Galach words, read:\r\n“O, Man!

She swung the door wide, looked through into massed\r\ngreenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it. A yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass! She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind. “A wet-planet conservatory,” she breathed. Potted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a\r\nmimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green\r\nand white striped akarso ... roses.... Even roses! She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to\r\npeer around the room. Rhythmic noise invaded her senses. She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of\r\nthe room.

Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a\r\nmethodical inspection of the room’s perimeter. It appeared to be about ten\r\nmeters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle\r\ndifferences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of\r\nthis wing iong after the original building’s completion. She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of\r\nfilter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded\r\nwith exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed,\r\nthen glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm\r\nlifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm\r\nretracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree. Water everywhere in this room—on a planet where water was the most\r\nprecious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked\r\nher to inner stillness. She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon\r\nabove cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the\r\nShield Wall. Filter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and\r\nmore familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him\r\nto surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been\r\nbusy with more serious problems. She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock\r\ndoors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it\r\nwas a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such\r\nprecautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent\r\ndust. But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of\r\nwaterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water\r\nenough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis—possibly more. Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The\r\nmove brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain\r\nand she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an\r\noverhanging fan leaf.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QRNIolknfkJv170pwu3ZPbZy50m4pCztUG8QgWTfyd8="},"4ea83696-6f5b-4425-bd23-126c654ce5e5":{"id_":"4ea83696-6f5b-4425-bd23-126c654ce5e5","metadata":{"page_number":83,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_83","metadata":{"page_number":83,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"eAYdcAtpXJ99ub1DOT25npNkJp7B/QzGLdWu3/M2zM8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9f6ff7cf-15d7-43c7-93cc-cff8f8711be2","metadata":{"page_number":83,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"QRNIolknfkJv170pwu3ZPbZy50m4pCztUG8QgWTfyd8="}},"text":"She crossed to the table, noted Hawat’s daysigns on it,\r\nstudied a message written on the pad:\r\n“TO THE LADY JESSICA—\r\nMay this place give you as much pleasure as it has given","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jnRPrMxQ7XuvLkwM/p0eTf9F2xyMaaxVnCIlLPSYPks="},"0d1d1f1a-22cf-4ce0-9f8f-89d0f83ead19":{"id_":"0d1d1f1a-22cf-4ce0-9f8f-89d0f83ead19","metadata":{"page_number":84,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_84","metadata":{"page_number":84,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"tKHKdHl4VOsNNri5QCTgHv+I2D15cVzBTgXsQnY/Gi0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8ebc6a2d-c63e-4933-abca-5d3f391b6a10","metadata":{"page_number":84,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"E9nLWzZZW4EuihfRQPYCNlfOgVx41XezLqWmrmITH/g="}},"text":"me.

But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She\r\nlooked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the\r\nunder surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers\r\ndetected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:\r\n“Your son and the Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been\r\ndesigned to attract your son.

What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full\r\nconference? ”\r\nHawat’s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny\r\nwrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he\r\nsaid: “My Lord, I don’t quite know how to broach this. ”\r\n“We’ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,” the Duke said. “You\r\nknow you can broach any subject with me. ”\r\nHawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This\r\nis the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why\r\nmust I hurt him? “Well? ” Leto demanded. Hawat shrugged. “It’s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen\r\ncourier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We’ve good\r\nreason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note—it’s a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It’s susceptible to various interpretations. ”\r\n“What’s the delicate content of this note? ”\r\n“Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the\r\nusual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of\r\nfull erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely\r\nsuggestive. ”\r\n“Yes? ”\r\nHawat rubbed at his lips. “It says: ‘... eto will never suspect, and when the\r\nblow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to\r\ndestroy him.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"phm6c2wmqe6xXflLI/3+MlojYUMk7oSgmr1oYBGuPOs="},"40c2567c-c19b-4384-90c0-c54a00be382e":{"id_":"40c2567c-c19b-4384-90c0-c54a00be382e","metadata":{"page_number":111,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_111","metadata":{"page_number":111,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"irzLwX/Xmn5ITyMBX4QT3ckkma4ltUKITt5HsxHiPSw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"786019ef-3b36-4807-8a27-f31282fc25c6","metadata":{"page_number":111,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"phm6c2wmqe6xXflLI/3+MlojYUMk7oSgmr1oYBGuPOs="}},"text":"’ The note was under the Baron’s own seal and I’ve\r\nauthenticated the seal. ”\r\n“Your suspicion is obvious,” the Duke said and his voice was suddenly\r\ncold.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"R3zioq5itV75JkxkQFPJW/nnWMnYLB5s/CwWzxk6prk="},"22df5b20-5bb4-47bf-a1ec-d4d7c7a95767":{"id_":"22df5b20-5bb4-47bf-a1ec-d4d7c7a95767","metadata":{"page_number":112,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_112","metadata":{"page_number":112,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"A/HTIDSr1Jn41h+ln/ciDA5LwNOSKLcQ+4erhtjhyZQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f2949114-589c-42aa-8a50-1661558f3ce6","metadata":{"page_number":112,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"N1p3rNQfapN2yqYCh8K7aLFrLrWmK2QjM7QtRV/w+5Q="}},"text":"“I’d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,” Hawat said. “My Lord, what\r\nif.... ”\r\n“The Lady Jessica,” Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. “Couldn’t\r\nyou wring the facts out of this Pardee? ”\r\n“Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we\r\nintercepted the courier.

A guard at the corner of the balcony,\r\nrecognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped\r\nto attention. “At ease,” the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the\r\nbalcony rail. A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight\r\noverhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the\r\nsouthern horizon, the night’s second moon peered through a thin dust haze—\r\nan unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light. As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs,\r\nfrosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered. Anger shot through him. The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last\r\ntime, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I\r\nmake my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye\r\nand claw—asthe hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed\r\nthe hawk emblem on his tunic. To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell\r\nopalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling\r\nmovement of dawn striking across a broken horizon. It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention. Some things beggar likeness, he thought. He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that\r\nshattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing\r\nfield where the night’s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of\r\nArrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an\r\narticulate tread of violet... like giant footsteps. “It’s a beautiful morning, Sire,” the guard said. “Yes, it is. ”\r\nThe Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son. Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping\r\nthem with strange scythe-like devices—dew gatherers.

The thing’s sensor arms hung limply over the table,\r\nreminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead. The Duke’s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and\r\nits roiling of dust against the morning sky. Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen\r\nreligious practices.

And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made\r\none think the boy had always worn such clothing. “The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see, ” went the\r\nprophecy. Kynes shook his head, telling himself: They’re just people. With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes\r\nrecognized—Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his\r\nresentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the\r\nDuke and ducal heir. “You may call the Duke ‘my Lord’ or ‘Sire. ’ ‘Noble Born’ also is correct,\r\nbut usually reserved for moreformal occasions.

You and Paul take the rear seats. ”\r\n“One moment, please,” Kynes said. “With your permission, Sire, I must\r\ncheck the security of your suits. ”\r\nThe Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: “I have concern for my\r\nown flesh as well as yours ... my Lord. I’m well aware of whose throat would\r\nbe slit should harm befall you two while you’re in my care. ”\r\nThe Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may\r\noffend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet ... to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little\r\nabout him? The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kHGclChkVpWhZKEs34EfxwtjfwVRt4JvW8WvYXVl+Mw="},"7a5d1b39-c80c-4c5e-bd7e-95c5d0aafd6a":{"id_":"7a5d1b39-c80c-4c5e-bd7e-95c5d0aafd6a","metadata":{"page_number":121,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_121","metadata":{"page_number":121,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"OIx7mR1XlZUT/2b4EVgyV9MzpdjROw+pfuyL0vyMt4M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"edfce9be-d9e8-49dd-847e-c012de2bdcf9","metadata":{"page_number":121,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"kHGclChkVpWhZKEs34EfxwtjfwVRt4JvW8WvYXVl+Mw="}},"text":"The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. “We’re in your hands,” the Duke said.

I’m in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to\r\nthat. He knew his mood’s source.

Water slopped over the\r\nbrim onto the linen. The others drank in embarrassed silence. Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its\r\nremaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must\r\ndo the same.

Halleck’s music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor\r\nkey, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood. “Let the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair. He’s angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler\r\nhit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that\r\nloss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion\r\nto hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.

The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time,\r\nand she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2\r\nA.M. The disturbance was loud and incoherent.

The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they’d\r\nhastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn’t\r\npenetrating to his quarters.

There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr. Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into\r\nslippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg. Again, a voice called out for Yueh. Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the\r\nthought struck her: What if Leto’s hurt? The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned\r\nthrough the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage\r\nto the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors\r\nglowing at maximum.

His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow\r\nin the room’s light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife\r\narm. She smelled blood there.

Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his\r\ntiredness. A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just\r\nnow as the Duke arrived from his command post. The note read: “A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night. ”\r\nThere was no signature. What does it mean? he wondered. The messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he\r\ncould be questioned. He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow. Leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat\r\nlater. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The\r\nantifatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had been a long two days\r\nsince the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept. On top of all the military problems, there’d been the disquieting session\r\nwith Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica. Should I waken Jessica? he wondered. There’s no reason to play the\r\nsecrecy game with her any longer. Or is there? Blast and damn that Duncan Idaho! He shook his head. No, not Duncan. I was wrong not to take Jessica into\r\nmy confidence from the first. I must do it now, before more damage is done. The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through\r\nthe Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing. At the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A\r\nstrange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put\r\nhis left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right\r\nhand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RHp4Lb+t48KvJE1OSpKOCgzXhzU38JdGvlU/y3y5ujc="},"4f1fe1c4-977c-4d5d-86e4-2a6d6bf82ee5":{"id_":"4f1fe1c4-977c-4d5d-86e4-2a6d6bf82ee5","metadata":{"page_number":173,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_173","metadata":{"page_number":173,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"L3ZG5vdJhih2e9lsMF/Qn+DAqtvlXO2WgYMLGICqUqg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"25d31cb0-4c45-441a-9b5a-84cc5fabab7f","metadata":{"page_number":173,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"RHp4Lb+t48KvJE1OSpKOCgzXhzU38JdGvlU/y3y5ujc="}},"text":"The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance.

The litter-\r\nbearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat. Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The ’thopter took off in a wing-\r\ntucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall.

Out the port he saw the flame-\r\nlighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall\r\nwhere his secret weapon was doing its work. Explosive artillery. The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke’s fighting men had retreated\r\nfor a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock\r\nand dust in the brief illumination—and the Duke’s men were being sealed off\r\nto die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows. The Baron could feel the distant chomping—a drumbeat carried to him\r\nthrough the ship’s metal: broomp... broomp. Then: BROOMP-BROOMP! Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought\r\nwas a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke’s men would run\r\nfor those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving\r\nthe lives of our mutual force. He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against\r\nthe pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls. A pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke’s, he thought. He smiled\r\nmore broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure\r\nwas, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man\r\nwho could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed,\r\nmade to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed\r\nthem? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he\r\nthought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you. A door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-\r\nblackened viewport before turning.

There were tatters at his waist where the\r\nshield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The\r\nDuke’s eyes held a glazed, insane look. “Wel-l-l-l,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He\r\nknew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long-envisioned, had lost\r\nsome of its savor.

And a gross, fat man on\r\nthe other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt\r\nhimself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps\r\nthat held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a\r\npassage of time, but its length escaped him. “I believe he’s coming around, Baron. ”\r\nA silky voice, that one. That was Piter. “So I see, Piter. ”\r\nA rumbling basso: the Baron. Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath\r\nhim took on firmness, the bindings were sharper. And he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the\r\nman’s hands: compulsive touchings—the edge of a plate, the handle of a\r\nspoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl. Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it. “You can hear me, Duke Leto,” the Baron said. “I know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you\r\nsired on her. ”\r\nNo sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him.

It pained the Baron that this\r\ncould not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others\r\nsee royalty in such straits—it set a bad precedent. Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth\r\nstood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped\r\ncapsule within that tooth—the poison gas—he remembered who had put the\r\ndeadly weapon in his mouth. Yueh.

It was Mentat power and more. Paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange ‘thopter\r\ndived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert\r\nwith wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul’s mind had\r\nhappened then. The ’thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge\r\ntoward the running figures—his mother and himself. Paul remembered how\r\nthe smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of ’thopter skids against sand had\r\ndrifted across them. His mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of\r\nHarkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the\r\n’thopter’s open door shouting: “Hurry! There’s wormsign south of you! ”\r\nBut Paul had known as he turned who piloted the ’thopter.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VMZk7g7QksmwbuqfNyP3XNGbaRSGbCTobAN+ACIFNZ4="},"e3ad1958-eeb7-4397-a86f-285fc9c03a3f":{"id_":"e3ad1958-eeb7-4397-a86f-285fc9c03a3f","metadata":{"page_number":204,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_204","metadata":{"page_number":204,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"szNThRnLFjYY2OIeRjDJAhktCAqmMJYSE1E4h4Mngpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"38b22709-7786-4267-94f9-e0e93b05d8a0","metadata":{"page_number":204,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"VMZk7g7QksmwbuqfNyP3XNGbaRSGbCTobAN+ACIFNZ4="}},"text":"”\r\nBut Paul had known as he turned who piloted the ’thopter.

He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note\r\nthat had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack. “Do not try to forgive me,” Yueh had written. “I do not want your\r\nforgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done\r\nwithout malice or hope of another’s understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-\r\nburhan, my ultimate test.

Remembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment—\r\na thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mental\r\nalertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words,\r\nbut had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind\r\nand used. I loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. I should mourn\r\nhim. I should feel something. But he felt nothing except: Here’s an important fact. It was one with all the other facts. All the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating,\r\ncomputing. Halleck’s words came back to Paul: “Mood’s a thing for cattle or for\r\nmaking love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. ”\r\nPerhaps that’s it, Paul thought. I’ll mourn my father later ... when there’s\r\ntime.

The man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across\r\nthe sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into\r\nthe dunes, his movements barely discernible.

Now, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his\r\ntorn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows. The size of the attack. He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the\r\nGuild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of\r\nHouse-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to\r\ntransport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against\r\nrandom raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they’d expected no\r\nmore than ten brigades. But there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last\r\ncount—not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troop-\r\ncarriers, dump-boxes.... More than a hundred brigades—ten legions! The entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost\r\nof such a venture. It might.

Their last ’thopter,\r\nthe one they’d been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded,\r\nhad given out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden\r\nthe pieces, then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of\r\nthe basin.

You must make a water decision,\r\nfriend. ”\r\n“Can we hire your help? ”\r\nThe Fremen shrugged. “You have no water. ” He glanced at the group\r\nbehind Hawat. “How many of your wounded would you spend? ”\r\nHawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their\r\ncommunication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up\r\nhere in the normal manner. “I am Thufir Hawat,” he said. “I can speak for my Duke. I will make\r\npromissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help,\r\npreserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself\r\nbeyond vengeance. ”\r\nYou wish our siding in a vendetta? ”\r\n“The vendetta I’ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for\r\nmy wounded that I may get about it. ”\r\nThe Fremen scowled. “How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are their own responsibility. The water’s at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would\r\nyou have me take that decision away from you? ”\r\nThe man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe. Hawat tensed, wondering: Is there betrayal here? “What do you fear? ” the Fremen demanded.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"207MPdkgCCSiPxyvV6oXj5n5zpsnSzotECISI8imaF8="},"e64651f4-c7cf-48a2-b5ee-68baa72c5591":{"id_":"e64651f4-c7cf-48a2-b5ee-68baa72c5591","metadata":{"page_number":227,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_227","metadata":{"page_number":227,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"N4Shko5EPUOTJUyeb0qaEQbEJN1HEtckAHGbhauc/1E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9588a990-ad9c-47fc-b673-c5b08dbb47f2","metadata":{"page_number":227,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"207MPdkgCCSiPxyvV6oXj5n5zpsnSzotECISI8imaF8="}},"text":"“What do you fear? ” the Fremen demanded.

He grinned. “And\r\nSardaukar. ” He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and\r\ntipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An\r\naircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless. ”\r\nAt a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed. The Fremen took Hawat’s arm, pressed him back with the others. “We will\r\nfight in the time of fighting,” the man said.

And Kynes realized in that moment\r\nthe dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth—and this was not\r\na thing to be taken lightly. Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the\r\nBene Gesserit way—a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in\r\nthe ancient manner. “This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted\r\nas advance bases,” Paul said. His father wanted! Kynes thought. And again Kynes wondered at himself. Am I foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It’d be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen\r\ntrust with them. Paul followed his mother’s example, gestalting the room, seeing the\r\nworkbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the\r\nbench—dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from\r\nthem. An ozone smell permeated the place. Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber\r\nand new sounds started there—machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning\r\nbelts and multidrives. Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them\r\nstacked against the wall. “You’ve recognized this place correctly,” Kynes said. “For what would\r\nyou use such a place, Paul Atreides? ”\r\n“To make this planet a fit place for humans,” Paul said. Perhaps that’s why I help them, Kynes thought. The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there\r\ncame a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though\r\nin embarrassment. Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-\r\nwinged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the\r\ncages.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/zvdv5JondK0pen4rkv2rbih+gAzSs+3iQrEe1IG7XQ="},"bfdba41a-6daf-45e5-93bc-6c3cde8ff660":{"id_":"bfdba41a-6daf-45e5-93bc-6c3cde8ff660","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_239","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"wKjGHUml0ST7M2f2/KTn0/wu+UlQgmb4PQJ4bEfDE/8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9fe3e598-08bf-43c4-b421-a5fbf77cd4f7","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"uOByyyj8cTwdgRZ3+IPnqy1Zx06iYkG+ZImJR5M2aW4="}},"text":"A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes:\r\n“Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working.

It was a royal voice,\r\naccustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as\r\nLiet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist. “We’re most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,” she said. “Mm-m-m, we’ll see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. “Spice\r\ncoffee in my quarters, Shamir. ”\r\n“At once, Liet,” the man said. Kynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. “If you\r\nplease? ”\r\nJessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a\r\nhand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here. The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square\r\noffice lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door\r\nas she entered, was startled to identify plasteel. Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He\r\nheard the door close behind him, studied the place—about eight meters to a\r\nside, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on\r\ntheir right. A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles\r\noccupied the room’s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk. Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting\r\nthe way her son examined the room. Paul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the\r\nroom’s air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the\r\nfiling cabinets.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nawXGCI8jpbNxHBZAgByOn0I24vGLobVmSEzgD8TNDE="},"9fe3e598-08bf-43c4-b421-a5fbf77cd4f7":{"id_":"9fe3e598-08bf-43c4-b421-a5fbf77cd4f7","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_239","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"wKjGHUml0ST7M2f2/KTn0/wu+UlQgmb4PQJ4bEfDE/8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bfdba41a-6daf-45e5-93bc-6c3cde8ff660","metadata":{"page_number":239,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"nawXGCI8jpbNxHBZAgByOn0I24vGLobVmSEzgD8TNDE="}},"text":"“Will you sit down, Paul Atreides? ” Kynes asked.

Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened\r\nby the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the ’thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the\r\nopposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand.

To stop, she thought. To rest... truly rest. It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.

Then, because\r\nit was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity,\r\nshe searched and found the source of her formality: I’m afraid of my son;\r\nIfearhis strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell\r\nme.

He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell\r\nof cinnamon. “There’s melange spice nearby,” he said.

Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps ... the sand itself must shift down at\r\ntimes. Worms can’t investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested\r\nbefore we try it, though. ”\r\nHe looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the\r\nvertical moonshadows there. “It’ll be dawn within the hour. ”\r\n“Where’ll we spend the day? ” she asked. Paul turned left, pointed. “The cliff curves back north over there. You can\r\nsee by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward face.

But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the\r\nopen desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does. They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a\r\nfissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule. Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was\r\nobvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a\r\nworld of deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars\r\naround them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at the brink of\r\na dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness. “Can we go down? ” Jessica whispered. “I think so. ”\r\nHe tested the surface with one foot. “We can slide down,” he said. “I’ll go first.

Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he\r\nfound the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig,\r\nmoving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric\r\ncame under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the\r\narm, exposed her face. “Do you hear me? ” he whispered. No answer. He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he\r\ndetected a slow heartbeat. Bindu suspension, he told himself. He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders\r\nand pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could,\r\nfeeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with\r\nthe effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor\r\nof the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a\r\nstaggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that\r\nechoed and was magnified within the rock walls.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SN+jw0g592A79tgBjvRVDBIYs36KRzydUAUfTGCGnsg="},"6b9ad7ee-3c29-4778-8bb8-cf47741cd12c":{"id_":"6b9ad7ee-3c29-4778-8bb8-cf47741cd12c","metadata":{"page_number":269,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_269","metadata":{"page_number":269,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"K3rOUgVXLIWSZSxjv/QuUYayEzTtUyx8xMrV1TDyWhM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8c8ef092-b75c-42e8-8647-2f2d9ef57d62","metadata":{"page_number":269,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"SN+jw0g592A79tgBjvRVDBIYs36KRzydUAUfTGCGnsg="}},"text":"He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert’s\r\nmarching dunes some thirty meters below.

Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe,\r\nreturned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of Jessica,\r\nsquatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts\r\non it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out next, leaving\r\nan empty dished compartment in the instrument. “You’ll need water,” Jessica said. Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it\r\ninto the dished compartment. If this fails, that’s water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won’t matter then,\r\nanyway. With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the\r\nwater. They foamed slightly, subsided. Jessica’s eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of\r\nhawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the\r\nopen water. Great Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance! Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button\r\nwhich gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in\r\none hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure,\r\nstudying the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to\r\nhold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off the sand rivulets, spurts\r\nof dust. Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass,\r\nshook the instrument case. Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul\r\naimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand\r\nbeneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.

We may have to widen this hole. ” He moved a step aside, slipping in loose\r\nsand. “Slant your digging backward. Don’t go straight down. ”\r\nJessica obeyed.

We mustn’t break it. ”\r\nMore sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap\r\ncleared the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together\r\nthen they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap. In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack\r\nbetween them. Paul looked at his mother. Foam strained her face, her robe. Sand was\r\ncaked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a\r\ntarget for balls of wet, green sand. “You look a mess,” he said. “You’re not so pretty yourself,” she said. They started to laugh, then sobered. “That shouldn’t have happened,” Paul said. “I was careless. ”\r\nShe shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe. “I’ll put up the tent,” he said. “Better slip off that robe and shake it out. ”\r\nHe turned away, taking the pack. Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer. “There’s anchor holes in the rock,” Paul said. “Someone’s tented here\r\nbefore. ”\r\nWhy not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place—\r\ndeep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away—far\r\nenough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access\r\nbefore a crossing. She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere\r\nblending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his\r\nbinoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the\r\noil lenses on the other cliff, lifting golden tan in morning light across open\r\nsand. Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing\r\ninto sand rivers and canyons. “There are growing things over there,” he said.

He lowered his\r\nbinoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his\r\nlips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. “This has the feeling\r\nof a Fremen place,” he said. “Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly? ” she asked. “Kynes promised their help. ”\r\nBut there’s desperation in the people of this desert, she thought.

There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan—she\r\nand the Duke Leto, before Paul’s birth. They’d flown over the southern\r\njungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery—man-gangs carrying their\r\nloads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there’d\r\nbeen the white petals of trimaran dhows. All of it gone. Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of\r\nthe day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the\r\nopen sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen\r\nthrough cheap glass. A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that\r\nwere beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sand-fall was gone,\r\nshe still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never\r\nforgotten. “Worm,” Paul whispered.

He turned, ducked through it and out of the\r\noffice. He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had\r\nbeen led by Tuek’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the\r\nnative rock, it’s smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the\r\njob. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural\r\nsupporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls. Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand\r\nwere standing—no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler\r\nmedics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were\r\nassembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides\r\ncompanion. The Atreides training—“We care for our own!”—it held like a core of\r\nnative rock in them, Halleck noted. One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck’s nine-string\r\nbaliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: “Sir, the medics here\r\nsay there’s no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here—\r\nonly outpost medicine. Mattai can’t last, they say, and he has a request of\r\nyou. ”\r\n“What is it? ”\r\nThe lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. “Mattai wants a song to ease his\r\ngoing, sir.

The Count, a dapper and ugly little\r\nman, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I\r\nwas dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of\r\nus spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the\r\nslave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-\r\nGuild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor,\r\nbut the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their\r\nsimilarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at\r\navoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful\r\nthing to say, but I’m not at all sure my father was innocent in\r\nall these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave concubine, then, red-haired like my\r\nfather, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer’s muscles, and\r\nher training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My\r\nfather looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed\r\nbefore him. Finally he said: “She is too beautiful.

Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild\r\ncolor spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness\r\ntesting the sand.

It was as though some step he had taken\r\nhad plunged him into a well ... or into the trough of a wave where the future\r\nwas invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting. Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a hyper-\r\nacceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available\r\naspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was\r\nsome eighty meters in diameter ... crystal teeth with the curved shape of\r\ncrysknives glinting around the rim ... the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle\r\naldehydes ... acids.... The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A\r\nshower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place. Paul crowded his mother farther back. Cinnamon!

He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock\r\nbeneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for\r\nhis mother to follow.

He reached back, felt his mother’s arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow. Another step. “It goes on up to the top, I think,” he whispered. Shallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man-carved beyond a doubt. She followed the shadowy movement of Paul’s progress, feeling out the\r\nsteps. Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them.

He had to get away\r\nfrom here. His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face. A thought spread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a\r\nplanet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization\r\n—agriculture. And he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single\r\ntrack, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here\r\nwithout water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn’t. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the\r\nimpersonal hands of his planet. The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We\r\ndon’t die easily. I should be dead now ... I will be dead soon ... but I can’t\r\nstop being an ecologist. “The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences. ”\r\nThe voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it\r\nwas dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here\r\nbefore him—his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin. “Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son,” his father said. “You should’ve\r\nknown the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke. ”\r\nI’m delirious, Kynes thought. The voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through\r\nsand, turning to look in that direction—nothing except a curving stretch of\r\ndune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun. “The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life,”\r\nhis father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him. Why does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn’t he want\r\nme to see him? “Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life,” his father\r\nsaid. “Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more\r\nenergy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from\r\norganism to organism. ”\r\nWhy does he keep harping on the same subject?

Open water ... irrigation water ... it took five\r\nthousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing\r\nseason, he remembered. “Our first goal on Arrakis,” his father said, “is grassland provinces. We\r\nwill start with these mutated poverty grasses.

He imagined it\r\nnow—sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-\r\nanimal little makers—and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of\r\nclearest, pure, liquid, soothing water into.... A pre-spice mass! He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around\r\nhim than it had been. Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried\r\nflapping of wings. This is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the\r\nday sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate. “Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life,” his father\r\nsaid. “Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust\r\nto physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement\r\nnow, align it for our purposes. ”\r\n“Shut up, old man,” Kynes muttered. “We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire\r\nplanet,” his father said. “We must use man as a constructive ecological force\r\n—inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that\r\nplace—to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape. ”\r\n“Shut up! ” Kynes croaked. “It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship\r\nbetween worms and spice,” his father said. A worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker’s sure to come\r\nwhen this bubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker\r\nwithout hooks? He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him. Water so near—only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to\r\ncome, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it. Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression\r\nhis movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the\r\nsensation was remote.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZTO2SPzpgMq0cB2D7HzzjHBemostr53gn5Cf2ByQQkE="},"e0bc7123-f79d-40ae-b56a-21c2510f52a4":{"id_":"e0bc7123-f79d-40ae-b56a-21c2510f52a4","metadata":{"page_number":296,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_296","metadata":{"page_number":296,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"gcDt05wbm8a6HSryI19icaLHs+2EUxI95cShvbrFrQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8bef7dfc-a863-4c45-9ca5-aad104eb989d","metadata":{"page_number":296,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"ZTO2SPzpgMq0cB2D7HzzjHBemostr53gn5Cf2ByQQkE="}},"text":"He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the\r\nsensation was remote. “The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of\r\nnative life forms,” his father said. “How strange that so few people ever\r\nlooked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal nitrogen-","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HE4GZy0JdjglL2FY4x9sx6E5a4ML99LPSt+b4NRLEsE="},"725f7ec5-daf9-4ae6-b741-7cffa9d7204e":{"id_":"725f7ec5-daf9-4ae6-b741-7cffa9d7204e","metadata":{"page_number":297,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_297","metadata":{"page_number":297,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"0VQXAKOeCnUq+B575OdQ/U8rQhJPL93+bHmR8JpIMME="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"953e7059-09e1-4a7a-bcfa-e3bf55034e77","metadata":{"page_number":297,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"9VFWyxiBhSKFw1bzDUOzgJIrtiVpzhVesPeS5+WmIr8="}},"text":"oxygen-CO2 balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of\r\nplant cover.

Muscles refused to\r\nanswer his demand. Kynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a\r\ntime while its companions waited in mock indifference.

He squeezed\r\naround a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began\r\ninching upward—his back against one side, his feet against the other—\r\nslowly, as silently as he could. The roar of Stilgar’s voice echoed up to him: “Get back, you wormheaded\r\nlice! She’ll break my neck if you come near! ”\r\nA voice out of the basin said: “The boy got away, Stil. What are we—”\r\n“Of course he got away, you sand-brained ... Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman! ”\r\n“Tell them to stop hunting my son,” Jessica said. “They’ve stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great\r\ngods below! Why didn’t you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter? ”\r\n“Tell your men to fall back,” Jessica said. “Tell them to go out into the\r\nbasin where I can see them ... and you’d better believe that I know how many\r\nof them there are. ”\r\nAnd she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-\r\nminded as I think him, we have a chance. Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest\r\nand look down into the basin. Stilgar’s voice came up to him. “And if I refuse? How can you ... ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no\r\nharm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you’re\r\nworth ten times your weight of water. ”\r\nNow, the test of reason, Jessica thought.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NrJLm9ziQ0+RS0srNEJP5tM5SQ5aP2pXiCG21vHlG48="},"8c6dbb79-cdcf-4e3e-9326-8af61685eb17":{"id_":"8c6dbb79-cdcf-4e3e-9326-8af61685eb17","metadata":{"page_number":304,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_304","metadata":{"page_number":304,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"NXOnqjkwAVFhP6lJBiqwjSCdkqkSSQ2D8i6lbnNd5b0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2fcb885d-d3fa-4457-b052-41650643dac0","metadata":{"page_number":304,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"NrJLm9ziQ0+RS0srNEJP5tM5SQ5aP2pXiCG21vHlG48="}},"text":"”\r\nNow, the test of reason, Jessica thought.

Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped\r\nthe Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose\r\nfrom the rocks to face him. In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in\r\nFremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the\r\nmuzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe. “I am Chani, daughter of Liet. ”\r\nThe voice was lilting, half filled with laughter. “I would not have permitted you to harm my companions,” she said. Paul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon’s path and\r\nhe saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the\r\nfeatures out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to\r\nstillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once\r\ndescribed this face-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen\r\nMohiam: “I will meet her. ”\r\nAnd here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed. “You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage,” she said. “And you took the\r\nmost difficult way up here. Follow me; I’ll show you an easier way down. ”\r\nHe scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a\r\ntumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks.

They stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor. Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: “This will be a\r\ngood exchange of teachings.

Bakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka—the weeper. She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should\r\nweeping unite them? she asked herself. Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: “Chani,\r\ntake the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble. ”\r\nChani touched Paul’s arm. “Come along, child-man. ”\r\nPaul hid the anger in his voice, said: “My name is Paul. It were well you\r\n—”\r\n“We’ll give you a name, manling,” Stilgar said, “in the time of the mihna,\r\nat the test of aql. ”\r\nThe test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul’s\r\nascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, “My son’s been\r\ntested with the gom jabbar! ”\r\nIn the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them. “There’s much we don’t know of each other,” Stilgar said. “But we tarry\r\noverlong. Day-sun mustn’t find us in the open. ” He crossed to the man Paul\r\nhad struck down, said, “Jamis, can you travel? ”\r\nA grunt answered him. “Surprised me, he did. ’Twas an accident.

Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the\r\nquestions in her mind. “What is important for a leader is that which makes\r\nhim a leader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your powers, there\r\nmay come a day when one of us must challenge the other.

Before she could probe this, he said: “I do not necessarily offer myself as\r\nmate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable. But should\r\nyou become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to\r\nbelieve that I’m too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not\r\nenough concerned with the tribe’s needs. Even now they listen to us and\r\nwatch us. ”\r\nA man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought. “There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild\r\nspirits,” he said. “They must be eased through this period. I must leave no\r\ngreat reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to\r\nmaim and kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can\r\nbe avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that\r\ndistinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too\r\nfew individuals, and a people reverts to a mob. ”\r\nHis words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to\r\nher as to those who secretly listened, forced her to reevaluate him. He has stature, she thought.

Her inner timesense told her it\r\nwould soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded\r\nfrom the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within\r\nthis space. She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of\r\ngreat fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious\r\nassessment on personal security within Stilgar’s troop. She turned in the\r\nhammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock\r\nfloor and into her desert boots. I must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit’s\r\npumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember. She could still taste their morning meal—the morsel of bird flesh and grain\r\nbound within a leaf with spice honey—and it came to her that the use of time\r\nwas turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of\r\nrest. Night conceals; night is safest.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kfjjm4+WeF1/AgjSi+9i2UVgteQRV9D9j6aOxLB7VnA="},"7aef34e5-017f-48b9-adf5-76abeae1e06a":{"id_":"7aef34e5-017f-48b9-adf5-76abeae1e06a","metadata":{"page_number":320,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_320","metadata":{"page_number":320,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"FITjD0PAyQaCYb7eTL3JyI6RheFV0PYDMCzb34uT4UA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"60b414f9-2790-4f8a-bcba-f7938ded92da","metadata":{"page_number":320,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"kfjjm4+WeF1/AgjSi+9i2UVgteQRV9D9j6aOxLB7VnA="}},"text":"Night conceals; night is safest.

The point can\r\nalso cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your\r\nopponent’s blade. ”\r\nPaul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim\r\nround ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so,\r\nhe realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not\r\neven know if it could be broken. Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul. Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to\r\nfighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with\r\nutmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness\r\nnecessary for penetrating the enemy’s shield. In spite of constant warning\r\nfrom his trainers not to depend on the shield’s mindless blunting of attack\r\nspeed, he knew that shield-awareness was part of him. Jamis called out in ritual challenge: “May thy knife chip and shatter! ”\r\nThis knife will break then, Paul thought.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ESFe+Tywf394wIcb9cjoPVRur1A7GLWrl9saM1xuvuI="},"931f2d54-35f8-4dd3-b6d3-10af0c3f0209":{"id_":"931f2d54-35f8-4dd3-b6d3-10af0c3f0209","metadata":{"page_number":325,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_325","metadata":{"page_number":325,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"l+ivmMxICs6HaD6vAnnva/qpTMFjpwonsWc0kmMTWCo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"32078f53-00c0-48ae-87d8-4e0322eff30d","metadata":{"page_number":325,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"ESFe+Tywf394wIcb9cjoPVRur1A7GLWrl9saM1xuvuI="}},"text":"”\r\nThis knife will break then, Paul thought.

Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under\r\nthe glowglobes. And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack. And again. And again.

And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty\r\nfactor in Paul’s gift. Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear\r\nin his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho’s voice flowed through Paul’s\r\nawareness: “When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when you\r\ngive the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him.

The great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave’s opening. She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of\r\nher and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed\r\nit in the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness\r\nsoon would give her what these Fremen obviously had—the ability to sense\r\neven the slightest change in the air’s moisture.

She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over\r\nrocks ... and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her\r\nrobes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new\r\nnose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube\r\nthat trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath’s\r\nmoisture. The suit itself was a sweatbox. “Your suit will be more comfortable when you’ve adjusted to a lower\r\nwater content in your body, ” Stillgar had said. She knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more\r\ncomfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her\r\nmind. No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.

The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him. “Come, Usul. ”\r\nHe allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of\r\npeople being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and\r\nbeside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the\r\nrock floor. The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with\r\nthe movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the\r\noverhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric\r\nat his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar’s\r\nfeet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric. “The spirit leaves the body’s water when the first moon rises,” Stilgar\r\nintoned. “Thus it is spoken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom\r\nwill it summon? ”\r\n“Jamis,” the troop responded. Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of\r\nfaces. “I was a friend of Jamis,” he said. “When the hawk plane stooped upon\r\nus at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety. ”\r\nHe bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. “I take this robe as a\r\nfriend of Jamis—leader’s right. ” He draped the robe over a shoulder,\r\nstraightening. Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray\r\nof a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center, the\r\nbladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a\r\nparacompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an\r\nassortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of\r\nbundled feathers ... and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bYB0VRUoIfXhdsYxdt+W3cUqVlLZIX4yifj2wKKpe9Y="},"134c1cee-86b2-4219-96d6-bbb13326c6e3":{"id_":"134c1cee-86b2-4219-96d6-bbb13326c6e3","metadata":{"page_number":336,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_336","metadata":{"page_number":336,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"Wy/kmriu+HGs1JlOvPvIUqQZBbxvFx7SVRbxtiywGWY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"616fa9a9-af82-473d-afdb-6e3230f99a21","metadata":{"page_number":336,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"bYB0VRUoIfXhdsYxdt+W3cUqVlLZIX4yifj2wKKpe9Y="}},"text":"and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.

Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a\r\nwinding movement of people spiraling down the steps. Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of\r\nsilence that rasped her nerves with its urgency. The steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light\r\nof the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved\r\nceiling. Paul felt Chani’s hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill\r\nair, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of\r\nwater.

If he died this instant,\r\nthe thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less\r\nthan the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now—himself and his\r\nmother included—could stop the thing. Paul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed\r\nhim forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the\r\nbarrier in the glow of Stilgar’s globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of\r\nwater. It stretched away into shadows—deep and black—the far wall only\r\nfaintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters away. Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in\r\nthe presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its\r\ndeepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it. A splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of\r\nFremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters\r\nemptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a\r\nround gray eye above the pool’s rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the\r\nwater flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and\r\nthree-thirty-seconds drachms. Superb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted\r\nthat the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water’s\r\npassage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a\r\nprofound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were\r\nperfectionists. Jessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar’s side. Way was made\r\nfor her with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul’s eyes, but\r\nthe mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts. Stilgar looked at her.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dGB3ubdw1XDZCB/8+kXjA078b4U9KMkVCGYf1L0F4Qc="},"e9e68aa8-6ab6-441e-a442-6e0cf66a2a67":{"id_":"e9e68aa8-6ab6-441e-a442-6e0cf66a2a67","metadata":{"page_number":342,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_342","metadata":{"page_number":342,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"WgV4F7MMUt+0+Zvg7ACmn1s4agKG/XQfodRNpgo/6YQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"36a8f760-b36c-4d42-a57c-a9c28a12070e","metadata":{"page_number":342,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"dGB3ubdw1XDZCB/8+kXjA078b4U9KMkVCGYf1L0F4Qc="}},"text":"Stilgar looked at her. “There were those among us in need of water,” he\r\nsaid, “yet they would come here and not touch this water.

Visiting observers from the\r\nImperial Court—a Count and Lady Fenring—were on the Harkonnen\r\nhomeworld of Giedi Prime for the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the\r\nimmediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena. In honor of the na-Baron’s nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and\r\nsubjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and\r\neffort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of\r\ngaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the\r\nwalls along Court Way. But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps,\r\nthe scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the\r\nfurtive scurrying of the people. In the Baron’s blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the\r\nCount and his lady saw the price being paid—guards everywhere and\r\nweapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular\r\nuse. There were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even\r\nwithin the keep. The servants revealed their military training in the way they\r\nwalked, in the set of their shoulders ... in the way their eyes watched and\r\nwatched and watched. “The pressure’s on,” the Count hummed to his lady in their secret\r\nlanguage. “The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid\r\nhimself of the Duke Leto. ”\r\n“Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix,” she said. They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family\r\ngames. It was not a large hall—perhaps forty meters long and half that in\r\nwidth—but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper,\r\nand the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater\r\nspace.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+EhBnmio01uFEI+NJYTr6L91obF5bebNNGqoWr7xoI8="},"fbbcd81e-073e-4429-873c-2628c62b07a4":{"id_":"fbbcd81e-073e-4429-873c-2628c62b07a4","metadata":{"page_number":346,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_346","metadata":{"page_number":346,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"wUzFp9mibLI7o32BmqeRVb11Abt/oenIIbxSlFFV3O4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9c884c08-b111-493a-8865-f22b64acd91b","metadata":{"page_number":346,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"+EhBnmio01uFEI+NJYTr6L91obF5bebNNGqoWr7xoI8="}},"text":"“Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron,” the Count said.

They\r\nwere so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful\r\nclothing and banners. It came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just\r\nas avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt\r\nof the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger\r\nwithout its substance—yet.... Feyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the\r\narena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the\r\nsign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the black-\r\ngloved hand—the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn\r\nthis day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade. The adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to\r\nsense the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly\r\nguarded.

Feyd-Rautha prided himself that\r\nhe never used the pru-door and seldom needed distractors. But it was good to\r\nknow they were available this day—special plans sometimes involved special\r\ndangers. Again, silence settled over the arena. Feyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which\r\nthe gladiator would emerge. The special gladiator. The plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct,\r\nFeyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged—that was the danger. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man’s unconscious to\r\nimmobilize his muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word\r\nin his mind, mouthing it without sound: “Scum! ” To the audience, it would\r\nappear that an undrugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-\r\nBaron. And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the\r\nslavemaster. A low humming arose from the red door’s servo-motors as they were\r\narmed for opening. Feyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was\r\nthe critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the\r\ntrained eye much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be\r\nhyped on elacca drug to come out kill-ready in fighting stance—but you had\r\nto watch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in defense,\r\nwhether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands. The way a\r\nslave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint. The red door slammed open. Out charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes. His skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd-\r\nRautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red\r\nbelt of a semishield—the belt’s arrow pointing left to indicate the slave’s left\r\nside was shielded. He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward\r\nin the stance of a trained fighter.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U5T+3OBvjrtbJaGHIeuAijOYPzfN+zVLqdaCBnfHoUY="},"775cedab-86bf-4f65-a078-1df64a34aacd":{"id_":"775cedab-86bf-4f65-a078-1df64a34aacd","metadata":{"page_number":356,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_356","metadata":{"page_number":356,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"BsXQa2rinaSb1V8KmInTQOq1D4phSlzDxnlpMmfhkPs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ef750939-cc05-47bb-a4b5-c01718673fa9","metadata":{"page_number":356,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"U5T+3OBvjrtbJaGHIeuAijOYPzfN+zVLqdaCBnfHoUY="}},"text":"He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward\r\nin the stance of a trained fighter.

Feyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave. “What has he done to his arm? ” asked one of the distractors. Feyd-Rautha’s attention went to a bloody scratch on the man’s left\r\nforearm, followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in\r\nblood on the left hip of the green leotards—a wet shape there: the formalized\r\noutline of a hawk. Hawk! Feyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him\r\nwith uncommon alertness. It’s one of Duke Leto’s fighting men we took on Arrakis! Feyd-Rautha\r\nthought. No simple gladiator this! A chill ran through him, and he wondered\r\nif Hawat had another plan for this arena—a feint within a feint within a feint. And only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame! Feyd-Rautha’s chief handler spoke at his ear: “I like not the look on that\r\none, m’Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him. ”\r\n“I’ll set my own barbs,” Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long,\r\nhooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These barbs,\r\ntoo, were supposed to be drugged—but not this time, and the chief handler\r\nmight die because of that. But it was all part of the plan. “You’ll come out of this a hero, ” Hawat had said. “Killed your gladiator\r\nman to man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and\r\nyour man will step into his spot. ”\r\nFeyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the\r\nmoment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands\r\nabove him were aware that something was wrong.

The slave grapevine had carried Hawat’s\r\nmessage to this one: “You’ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron. ” That\r\nmuch of the scheme was as they’d planned it, then. A tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha’s mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing\r\nsuccess for his plans in the way the gladiator stood. “Hai! Hai! ” the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps. No one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd-Rautha thought. This slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror. Every\r\nmovement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope\r\nfor him—he could not win. He should have been filled with the stories of the\r\npoisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his white-gloved hand. The na-\r\nBaron never gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons,\r\ncould stand in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing\r\nvictim. There was fear in the slave, yes—but not terror. Feyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting. The gladiator pounced. His feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever\r\nseen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the\r\ntendons of the na-Baron’s left leg. Feyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave’s right\r\nforearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not\r\nwithdraw thim without ripping tendons. A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries. The sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation. He knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the\r\nFenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him. There could be\r\nno interference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front of\r\nwitnesses. And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one\r\nway—threat to himself. The slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his\r\narm with the pennant. “I do not feel your needle! ” he shouted.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iXKzyH7kGOVkHfNi8KA47QRpeqVVUA8tBPo+j7J9zPU="},"7bb1e35a-cc8b-4eb6-8b14-401692fede22":{"id_":"7bb1e35a-cc8b-4eb6-8b14-401692fede22","metadata":{"page_number":358,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_358","metadata":{"page_number":358,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"a9O5mH55I7Q1L4yP3lcvA2lOFCSzZ7mlqwHMrpT0GvE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d2343207-7eec-4480-9a99-d713989efaed","metadata":{"page_number":358,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"iXKzyH7kGOVkHfNi8KA47QRpeqVVUA8tBPo+j7J9zPU="}},"text":"“I do not feel your needle! ” he shouted.

The board was filled with designs\r\n—circles, wedges and curves, snake tracks and squares, flowing arcs split by\r\nparallel lines. The woman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as\r\nshe could move the stylus, and the children chanted in rhythm with her\r\nmoving hand.

He felt a sudden reluctance\r\nto be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was surrounded by a way\r\nof life that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and\r\nvalues. He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare\r\nhim in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare—the wild jihad, the\r\nreligious war he felt he should avoid at any cost. “This is your yali,” Harah said. “Why do you hesitate? ”\r\nPaul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from\r\nher, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short entrance way\r\nand then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a side—thick blue\r\ncarpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls, glowglobes\r\ntuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics.

Harah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his face. “The children are with a friend,” she said. “They will present themselves\r\nlater. ”\r\nPaul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin\r\nhangings to the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with cushions\r\npiled around the walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct, saw the outlet\r\ncunningly hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him. “Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit? ” Harah asked. “No... thank you. ”\r\n“Shall I bring food? ”\r\n“Yes. ”\r\n“There is a reclamation chamber off the other room. ” She gestured. “For\r\nyour comfort and convenience when you’re out of your stillsuit. ”\r\n“You said we have to leave this sietch,” Paul said.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2SBgeupcwlvbNagEwWza24tFNReRTLb8vicKkqEuCus="},"675a6e49-e5a6-4010-a726-e2011e50b33f":{"id_":"675a6e49-e5a6-4010-a726-e2011e50b33f","metadata":{"page_number":372,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_372","metadata":{"page_number":372,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"DdDg03oieU8DTdlriV2Da+XCf9/ZOMYANDqIKb7pDrg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4b86b857-fedb-43b6-b54d-8e9afb993f18","metadata":{"page_number":372,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"2SBgeupcwlvbNagEwWza24tFNReRTLb8vicKkqEuCus="}},"text":"”\r\n“You said we have to leave this sietch,” Paul said. “Shouldn’t we be\r\npacking or something? ”\r\n“It will be done in its time,” she said. “The butchers have yet to penetrate\r\nto our region. ”\r\nStill she hesitated, staring at him. “What is it? ” he demanded. “You’ve not the eyes of the Ibad,” she said. “It’s strange but not entirely","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"meaDfc3TbwiWKPC3IyD6+Gb8kMjk9zOhIY8R7fl/RSg="},"6189997c-93e0-4914-a628-29df22a5431f":{"id_":"6189997c-93e0-4914-a628-29df22a5431f","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_373","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"5/mdHYXZDRBV0Yq0AotkR6/fXMJHM/WDY5vViwXmolY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d11ea1ff-1749-40b2-87b7-0fe0734f895b","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"4PO4TXr6SXydulD0Wolk4uSlXQcibj07S7en4T8JF8A="}},"text":"unattractive. ”\r\n“Get the food,” he said. “I’m hungry. ”\r\nShe smiled at him—a knowing, woman’s smile that he found disquieting. “I am your servant,” she said, and whirled away in one lithe motion, ducking\r\nbehind a heavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling\r\nback into place. Feeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the\r\nright and into the larger room. He stood there a moment caught by\r\nuncertainty. And he wondered where Chani was... Chani who had just lost\r\nher father. We’re alike in that, he thought. A wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by the\r\nintervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And again. Paul\r\nrealized someone was calling the time. He focused on the fact that he had\r\nseen no clocks. The faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on the\r\nomnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suppressed the\r\nodorous assault on his senses. And he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the\r\nfuture would incorporate her... and the daughter she bore. Mutable time-\r\nawareness danced around him. He shook his head sharply, focusing his\r\nattention on the evidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this\r\nFremen culture that had swallowed them. With its subtle oddities. He had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that suggested\r\nfar greater differences than anything he had yet encountered. There was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use\r\nanywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stench\r\n—strong ones, common ones. He heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food,\r\nand turned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of\r\nhangings, he saw two young boys—perhaps aged nine and ten—staring out at\r\nhim with greedy eyes. Each wore a small kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a\r\nhand on the hilt.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"D7cIUOYlEm4FpANeqvBG46Q+H+zDPm9p0dJ+A0tQN0k="},"d11ea1ff-1749-40b2-87b7-0fe0734f895b":{"id_":"d11ea1ff-1749-40b2-87b7-0fe0734f895b","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_373","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"5/mdHYXZDRBV0Yq0AotkR6/fXMJHM/WDY5vViwXmolY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6189997c-93e0-4914-a628-29df22a5431f","metadata":{"page_number":373,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"D7cIUOYlEm4FpANeqvBG46Q+H+zDPm9p0dJ+A0tQN0k="}},"text":"And Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen—that their children fought as\r\nferociously as the adults.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4PO4TXr6SXydulD0Wolk4uSlXQcibj07S7en4T8JF8A="},"ceb4403c-5280-46be-834f-003ef5f1e0ea":{"id_":"ceb4403c-5280-46be-834f-003ef5f1e0ea","metadata":{"page_number":374,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_374","metadata":{"page_number":374,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"onmXMiqBjgiCZp/YNhk8fIYciWEaJqZjWtrXLm5jCpw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cfbfa6e5-8500-4b63-b107-9478a1d90e04","metadata":{"page_number":374,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"PnlNSuAian6NiWhRoFEBS1C4cGsBSVUUL6stUON4ugI="}},"text":"The hands move, the lips move—Ideas gush from his words,\r\nAnd his eyes devour!

She estimated there were more than five thousand people gathered\r\nout there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar. And more were coming. The air was murmurous with people. “Your son has been summoned from his rest, Sayyadina,” Stilgar said. “Do\r\nyou wish him to share in your decision? ”\r\n“Could he change my decision? ”\r\n“Certainly, the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs, but\r\n—”\r\n“The decision stands,” she said.

What endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the\r\ndaughter. Men came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring\r\nup dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.

He indicated a rock bench within the horn. “The\r\nReverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she comes. ”\r\n“I prefer to stand,” Jessica said. She watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out at\r\nthe crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now. And still they came. Out on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in the\r\ncavern hall was perpetual twilight, a gray vastness thronged with people\r\ncome to see her risk her life.

We must move swiftly if we’re\r\nto secure our place among these Fremen. Paul climbed to the ledge, leaving the children below. He stopped in front\r\nof his mother, glanced at Stilgar, back to Jessica. “What is happening? I\r\nthought I was being summoned to council. ”\r\nStilgar raised a hand for silence, gestured to his left where another way had\r\nbeen opened in the throng. Chani came down the lane opened there, her elfin\r\nface set in lines of grief. She had removed her stillsuit and wore a graceful\r\nblue wraparound that exposed her thin arms. Near the shoulder on her left\r\narm, a green kerchief had been tied. Green for mourning, Paul thought. It was one of the customs the two sons of Jamis had explained to him by\r\nindirection, telling him they wore no green because they accepted him as\r\nguardian-father. “Are you the Lisan al-Gaib? ” they had asked. And Paul had sensed the\r\njihad in their words, shrugged off the question with one of his own—learning\r\nthen that Kaleff, the elder of the two, was ten, and the natural son of Geoff. Orlop, the younger, was eight, the natural son of Jamis. It had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because\r\nhe asked it, keeping away the curious, allowing him the time to nurse his\r\nthoughts and prescient memories, to plan a way to prevent the jihad.

With her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen\r\nmote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of oxygen... hydrogen.

With the old Reverend Mother! But Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn’t think of herself as old. An\r\nimage unfolded before the mutual mind’s eye: a young girl with a dancing\r\nspirit and tender humor. Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, “Yes, that is how I am. ”\r\nJessica could only accept the words, not respond to them. “You’ll have it all soon, Jessica,” the inward image said. This is hallucination, Jessica told herself. “You know better than that,” the inward image said. “Swiftly now, do not\r\nfight me. There isn’t much time. We.... ” There came a long pause, then: “You\r\nshould’ve told us you were pregnant! ”\r\nJessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. “Why? ”\r\n“This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done? ”\r\nJessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another mote-\r\npresence with the inward eye. The other mote darted wildly here, there,\r\ncircling. It radiated pure terror. “You’ll have to be strong,” the old Reverend Mother’s image-presence\r\nsaid. “Be thankful it’s a daughter you carry. This would’ve killed a male\r\nfetus. Now... carefully, gently... touch your daughter-presence. Be your\r\ndaughter-presence. Absorb the fear... soothe... use your courage and your\r\nstrength... gently now... gently.... ”\r\nThe other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch\r\nit.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tk4wTLj1t/3ldsqQ8ZpZHOL1cENZLimZQPAxVibULDw="},"e4afb4b8-09b4-44c4-b675-1ae58d9a01f6":{"id_":"e4afb4b8-09b4-44c4-b675-1ae58d9a01f6","metadata":{"page_number":381,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_381","metadata":{"page_number":381,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"hbr9JMIRlUjtfQ6FBUitVhaTqaYxqh8F973DcnPVtNM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"380482e7-0335-4b5e-b58f-e34da8ea4282","metadata":{"page_number":381,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"tk4wTLj1t/3ldsqQ8ZpZHOL1cENZLimZQPAxVibULDw="}},"text":"”\r\nThe other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch\r\nit.

The other mote lay quiescent\r\nagainst her. Words won’t work, Jessica told herself. She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a\r\nwarm snuggling of protection. The terror receded. Again, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now\r\nthere was a tripling of mutual awareness—two active and one that lay quietly\r\nabsorbing. “Time compels me,” the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. “I\r\nhave much to give you. And I do not know if your daughter can accept all\r\nthis while remaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are\r\nparamount. ”\r\n“What—”\r\n“Remain silent and accept! ”\r\nExperiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a\r\nsubliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school... but faster... blindingly faster. Yet... distinct. She knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover—virile,\r\nbearded, with the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strength and tenderness,\r\nall of him in one blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother’s memory. There was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the\r\ndaughter fetus, only time to accept and record. The experiences poured in on\r\nJessica—birth, life, death—important matters and unimportant, an outpouring\r\nof single-view time. Why should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory? she asked\r\nherself. Too late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and,\r\nin dying, pouring her experiences into Jessica’s awareness as water is poured\r\ninto a cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as Jessica\r\nwatched it. And, dying-in-conception, the old Reverend Mother left her life\r\nin Jessica’s memory with one last sighing blur of words. “I’ve been a long time waiting for you,” she said. “Here is my life. ”\r\nThere it was, encapsuled, all of it.

This wasn’t exactly how they did it at the Bene Gesserit school, she knew. No one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it, but she knew. The end result was the same. Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness,\r\nprobed it without response. A terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization of\r\nwhat had happened to her. She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed\r\nand all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became\r\nclearer. The sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her\r\nbody relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that other mote,\r\ntouching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it. I did it, my poor, unformed, dear little daughter, I brought you into this\r\nuniverse and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any\r\ndefenses. A tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured\r\ninto it, came from the other mote. Before Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding\r\nmemory. There was something that needed doing. She groped for it, realizing\r\nshe was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her\r\nsenses. I could change that, she thought. I could take away the drug action and\r\nmake it harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. I’m within a rite of\r\njoining. Then she knew what she had to do. Jessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above\r\nher by Chani. “It has been blessed,” Jessica said. “Mingle the waters, let the change come\r\nto all, that the people may partake and share in the blessing. ”\r\nLet the catalyst do its work, she thought.

And she realized they came from another memory, the life that had been\r\ngiven to her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt\r\nincomplete, though. “Let them have their orgy, ” the other-memory said within her. “They’ve\r\nlittle enough pleasure out of living.

There had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an\r\neasy planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human\r\ncolonies on Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus. Oh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.

The fragments were difficult to understand when\r\nsnatched out of the flux.

He turned down the hall out\r\nof the servants’ wing. “They’ve a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the\r\nFremen,” the Baron said. “They call him Muad‘Dib. Very funny, really. It\r\nmeans ‘the Mouse. ’ I’ve told Rabban to let them have their religion. It’ll keep\r\nthem occupied. ”\r\n“That’s very interesting, Uncle,” Feyd-Rautha said. He turned into the\r\nprivate corridor to his uncle’s quarters, wondering: Why does he talk about\r\nreligion? Is it some subtle hint to me? “Yes, isn’t it? ” the Baron said. They came into the Baron’s apartments through the reception salon to the\r\nbedchamber. Subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here—a suspensor lamp\r\ndisplaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel spilled open across a\r\nbedstand. “It was a clever plan,” the Baron said. He kept his body shield tuned to\r\nmaximum, stopped, facing his nephew. “But not clever enough.

Somewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the\r\ncry of a nightbird. I dream, Paul reassured himself. It’s the spice meal. Still, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered if it\r\nmight be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world\r\nwhere the Fremen believed he had his true existence—into the alam al-\r\nmithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical\r\nlimitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place,\r\nbecause removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In\r\nthe landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: “I am I because I\r\nam here. ”\r\nHis mother had said once: “The people are divided, some of them, in how\r\nthey think of you. ”\r\nI must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened\r\n—these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend\r\nMother of the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.

And she went questioning among the\r\ntribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding\r\non them.

Now, I\r\nmust be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the\r\nChronicles. ” She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped,\r\nthen she had herself under control. “When this is past, I shall prepare thy\r\nbreakfast with my own hands,” she said.

Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will be\r\nonly legend and nothing to stop the jihad. Stilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his\r\nsides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought\r\nhow his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice. “They denied us the Hajj,” Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.

Stilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice. “Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and directly —nothing fancy.

He turned toward the dune Stilgar had\r\nindicated—a dirty tan slope with an S -track crest. Already, most of the troop\r\nwas moving out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had\r\nsheltered their camp. One robed figure remained in Paul’s path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the\r\nFedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask. Shishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The\r\nshafts were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at\r\none end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip. Paul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual. “They are my own hooks,” Shishakli said in a husky voice. “They never\r\nhave failed. ”\r\nPaul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and\r\nup the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like\r\na flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy\r\nridge with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the\r\nviewpoint vantage. Stooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the\r\nsand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the\r\ndrumming.

He had seen it done. He had\r\nbeen helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive\r\nworm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert\r\nsurface and a new maker must be summoned. Once he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the\r\ntwenty-thumper journey into the southland—to rest and restore himself—into\r\nthe south where the women and the families had been hidden from the\r\npogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.

You may often hear it\r\nbefore you see it. ”\r\nAnd Chani’s words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him\r\novercame her, filled his mind: “When you take your stand along the maker’s\r\npath, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand.

The room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen\r\nsietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security. Yet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien\r\nplace. It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal. A faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber. Jessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay’s. Her time was near. And Jessica knew she’d see the baby soon enough—a blue-eyed cherub\r\nbrought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her\r\ndaughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it. It was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn’t have\r\nstarted a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave\r\nraids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep. Jessica sighed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZbsozRrgXd6qpu38n4FyzF+lxmmGsSczYUdfaxP5HTY="},"2f656a94-d527-42b4-9a5f-1c3d03613be8":{"id_":"2f656a94-d527-42b4-9a5f-1c3d03613be8","metadata":{"page_number":419,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_419","metadata":{"page_number":419,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"+tpi2RMYmFKXGhA0PW5+nLJWITBrXyRiqXZDqNdGD1U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2679583f-5516-42b2-b8d4-446fa3332ddd","metadata":{"page_number":419,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"ZbsozRrgXd6qpu38n4FyzF+lxmmGsSczYUdfaxP5HTY="}},"text":"Jessica sighed.

From the cup arose the aroma of spiced\r\ncoffee. An offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought. She took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society\r\nof our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an\r\nanonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison\r\nnow before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesn’t realize this. She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents—hot and\r\ndelicious. And she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for\r\nher privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit\r\nthe gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift\r\n—with only a slight tinge of fear. Another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had\r\nthought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here,\r\nshe knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a\r\ncompensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great\r\nmass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice\r\nseed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their\r\nminds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt\r\nand reacted sometimes like a single organism. And the thought of coincidence never entered their minds. Has Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He’s capable,\r\nbut accident can strike down even the most capable. The waiting. It’s the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the\r\ndreariness of the waiting overcomes you. There was all manner of waiting in their lives. More than two years we’ve been here, she thought, and twice that number\r\nat least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from\r\nthe Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban. “Reverend Mother? ”\r\nThe voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the\r\nother woman in Paul’s menage. “Yes, Harah.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2FbazOe5u+OU3UziM7DbiptKJqpEAJbzkkJlBN4gdZM="},"ee8f66cc-f47a-43b1-b429-9810cf79b7a1":{"id_":"ee8f66cc-f47a-43b1-b429-9810cf79b7a1","metadata":{"page_number":420,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_420","metadata":{"page_number":420,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"eVDsTCajywiM9LJLYPaq81fA7Xl0ByjZkicd/ViowWI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6ba28a8f-1f78-4f6e-91cc-07ba88abed7b","metadata":{"page_number":420,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"2FbazOe5u+OU3UziM7DbiptKJqpEAJbzkkJlBN4gdZM="}},"text":"“Yes, Harah. ”\r\nThe hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them.

Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the\r\nwings of an insect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory\r\nfeatures were drawn into an intense frown. Behind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years. Seeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia’s\r\nresemblance to Paul at that age—the same wide-eyed solemnity to her\r\nquesting look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle\r\ndifferences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child—little more than a toddler—carried herself with a calmness and\r\nawareness beyond her years. Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a\r\nsubtle play of words between the sexes. Or they’d catch themselves listening\r\nto her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate,\r\nand discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on\r\nexperiences no two-year-old had ever encountered. Harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child. “Alia. ” Jessica motioned to her daughter. The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her\r\nmother’s hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had\r\nshared since before Alia’s birth. It wasn’t a matter of shared thoughts—\r\nalthough there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing\r\nthe spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate\r\nawareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-\r\nsympatico that made them emotionally one. In the formal manner that befitted a member of her son’s household,\r\nJessica said: “Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well? ”\r\nWith the same traditional formality, she said: “Subakh un nar. I am well. ”\r\nThe words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.

The adult summation coming from\r\nthe child mouth was like a bitter confirmation. “You’re not a freak! ” Harah snapped. “Who dared say you’re a freak? ”\r\nAgain, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah’s\r\nvoice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly—they did need Harah. The tribe would understand Harah—both her words and her emotions—for it\r\nwas obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child. “Who said it? ” Harah repeated.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yFDe98+ISxzrDoSSXnMSMHh+p+yUqTbAF3tyl3RsD3U="},"0f1ccc2e-5a88-4807-bc92-10207558e6fa":{"id_":"0f1ccc2e-5a88-4807-bc92-10207558e6fa","metadata":{"page_number":424,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_424","metadata":{"page_number":424,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"FK8kJlphWap1PiedSLcah5e9rhxGhInOburY0jcAaV0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"90159d29-1550-4250-8ce8-1417919244bd","metadata":{"page_number":424,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"yFDe98+ISxzrDoSSXnMSMHh+p+yUqTbAF3tyl3RsD3U="}},"text":"“Who said it? ” Harah repeated. “Nobody. ”\r\nAlia used a corner of Jessica’s aba to wipe the tears from her face.

Silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the\r\nsietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh. Presently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the\r\nwords a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them. “We will never forgive and we will never forget,” Harah said.

He felt them bite and\r\npull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against\r\nthe clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted\r\nthe hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the\r\nsegment, the worm would not roll down and crush him. The worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it\r\nbegan to roll—up, up—bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible, away\r\nfrom the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment. Paul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an\r\nemperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to\r\nturn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature. Suddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash\r\nyoung men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on\r\ntheir backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could\r\nspill them. Leaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower\r\ndown the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down\r\nthe first one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it\r\nrolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others\r\nwaited. Paul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the\r\nsensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line\r\nbehind him, steadied against their hooks. Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul’s\r\nhooks, glanced up at Paul’s smiling face. “You did it, eh? ” Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their\r\npassage. “That’s what you think? You did it? ” He straightened. “Now I tell\r\nyou that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was drumsand to your left where you waited.

Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the\r\ndesert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the\r\nridge were swept clean by a recent storm. In the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted\r\nthe oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape. Beyond the\r\nridge, he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the\r\nsignal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate. The ’thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke away\r\nfrom the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with\r\nits detectors dangling close to the surface. Amost immediately, it went through the wing-tucked dip and circle that\r\ntold the waiting factory that spice had been found. Gurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal. He liked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection. This was\r\ndeep in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush ... still .... Gurney signaled\r\nfor a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station\r\nin pattern around the area—not too high because then they could be seen\r\nfrom afar by Harkonnen detectors. He doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This\r\nwas still Fremen country. Gurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless\r\nout here. Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs. He\r\nrubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be\r\nsafest to lead a ground party through the ridge.

A head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney—the factory\r\ncommander, a one-eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky\r\nteeth of a spice diet. “Looks like a rich patch, sir,” the factory commander said. “Shall I take’er\r\nin? ”\r\n“Come down at the edge of that ridge,” Gurney ordered. “Let me\r\ndisembark with my men.

He\r\nglanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude—not too high. He nodded to\r\nhimself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge. In that instant, the ridge erupted. Twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering ’thopters\r\nand carrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler,\r\nand the rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men. Gurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets!

A smile touched Paul’s mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression\r\nthat reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul’s grandfather. Gurney saw then\r\nthe sinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides\r\n—a leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the\r\nglance that seemed to weigh everything in sight. “They said you were dead,” Gurney repeated.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SKXyX03Vjm71/6opOILWtb473rbG4ClBuBSQNtc655c="},"6b93cbb0-397c-4904-9119-de78fa5127e1":{"id_":"6b93cbb0-397c-4904-9119-de78fa5127e1","metadata":{"page_number":440,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_440","metadata":{"page_number":440,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"VuR2sfQ0/gw9/3+j92QLWFaAkLC/V35MSjJ/j9mjDt0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"916fd9b4-53ca-42e8-be1a-517969a3d83d","metadata":{"page_number":440,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"SKXyX03Vjm71/6opOILWtb473rbG4ClBuBSQNtc655c="}},"text":"“They said you were dead,” Gurney repeated. “And it seemed the best protection to let them think so,” Paul said.

Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages, the\r\nwisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council. ”\r\nThere was shuffling silence among the crowd. “So,” Paul said. “Does my mother rule? ” He pointed down to Jessica in her\r\nblack robes of office among them. “Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask\r\nher advice in almost every major decision. You know this. But does a\r\nReverend Mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens? ”\r\nFrowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were\r\nangry murmurs. This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the\r\nmessage cylinder and what it implied. And she saw Paul’s intent: Go right to\r\nthe depth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow. “No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh? ”\r\nPaul asked. “That’s the way! ” someone shouted. “What’s our goal? ” Paul asked. “To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast,\r\nand remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in\r\nhappiness amidst an abundance of water—is this our goal? ”\r\n“Hard tasks need hard ways,” someone shouted. “Do you smash your knife before a battle? ” Paul demanded.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sC1rPPhU+z450aR4GehCUmoyv7tkBSA3SQq/g1pvKO4="},"00b39bef-20d8-4428-bd88-55b22994614b":{"id_":"00b39bef-20d8-4428-bd88-55b22994614b","metadata":{"page_number":456,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_456","metadata":{"page_number":456,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"01GYClVlQr1RV89qmLBzTWPYaBAZxWbuAUfJC/Ds86w="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5c79cb1c-35d2-4b79-b41d-5eec216c8e04","metadata":{"page_number":456,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"sC1rPPhU+z450aR4GehCUmoyv7tkBSA3SQq/g1pvKO4="}},"text":"“Do you smash your knife before a battle? ” Paul demanded. “I say this as\r\nfact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isn’t a man here, Stilgar\r\nincluded, who could stand against me in single combat.

As long as Chani lives, Paul will not see his duty, Jessica thought. She has\r\ngiven him a son and that is enough.

She gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto\r\nthe climbing path that only the desert-trained could recognize in the darkness. Pebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering\r\nthe nimbleness required. The climb was exhilarating, easing the fears that had fermented in her\r\nbecause of her escort’s silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious ‘thopter\r\nhad been sent for her. She felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion\r\nwith Paul-Muad’Dib, her Usul. His name might be a battle cry over all the\r\nland: “Muad‘Dib! Muad’Dib! Muad’Dib! ” But she knew a different man by\r\na different name—the father of her son, the tender lover. A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She\r\nquickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon. The figure above was not one of her own escort.

Slowly, the nostrils\r\nflared. Jessica gasped. Chani touched the dampened finger to Paul’s upper lip.

The oil lens was focused on a starship\r\nlighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the\r\nship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed\r\nyellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of\r\nArrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.

Now, he gave his thoughts over to this day’s\r\naccumulated discoveries—the mixed futures and the hidden presence of Alia\r\nwithin his awareness. Of all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. “I have breasted the\r\nfuture to place my words where only you can hear them,” Alia had said. “Even you cannot do that, my brother.

He signed to the guard to hold\r\nthe captive five paces in front of Paul. The Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A\r\nblue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous\r\nwith rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn\r\nuniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid\r\nof his trousers. “I think this one’s an officer, m’Lord,” Gurney said.

In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the\r\nFremen naib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and\r\nobedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the\r\njihad in it. I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.

Her presence\r\ncarried some of its old assertiveness. Jessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue\r\nand how he hid it, but found no compassion for him.

There\r\ncame a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted\r\ninto the Residency. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His burseg\r\nhelmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform’s left\r\nsleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without\r\nweapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that\r\nkept his immediate area open. A Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had\r\nordered. The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and\r\nof staring faces. Paul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of\r\nweeping, saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a\r\nSardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw the\r\nbird-bright eyes of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring\r\nbeneath her black hood, and beside her the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-\r\nRautha Harkonnen. There’s a face time betrayed to me, Paul thought. He looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing\r\nthere a narrow, weaselish face he’d never before encountered—not in time or\r\nout of it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a\r\nmarker of fear. Why should I fear that man? he wondered. He leaned toward his mother, whispered: “That man to the left of the\r\nReverend Mother, the evil-looking one—who is that? ”\r\nJessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke’s dossiers. “Count\r\nFenring,” she said. “The one who was here immediately before us. A genetic-\r\neunuch ... and a killer. ”\r\nThe Emperor’s errand boy, Paul thought. And the thought was a shock\r\ncrashing across his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in\r\nuncounted associations spread through the possible futures—but never once\r\nhad Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0vsRSl+Ivz/tdpcXFLd8ZoDJkdgCIU+jgdLf7IkcCoQ="},"20530e5f-3dfb-4e47-8abb-8699f31d40ce":{"id_":"20530e5f-3dfb-4e47-8abb-8699f31d40ce","metadata":{"page_number":504,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_504","metadata":{"page_number":504,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"kwt4mo9JY27vjLqNRYY66DmVWbmwlWJgYBIdCQqktus="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8191a169-12f1-4b5c-a3ac-8118ef97ccf9","metadata":{"page_number":504,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"0vsRSl+Ivz/tdpcXFLd8ZoDJkdgCIU+jgdLf7IkcCoQ="}},"text":"It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along\r\ncountless reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of\r\ndeath.

If you’re to strike me, do it now. ”\r\n“I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke,” Hawat said. And\r\nPaul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep\r\nfrom falling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the shoulders, feeling the\r\nmuscle tremors beneath his hands. “Is there pain, old friend? ” Paul asked. “There is pain, my Duke,” Hawat agreed, “but the pleasure is greater. ” He\r\nhalf turned in Paul’s arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward the\r\nEmperor, exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. “See,\r\nMajesty? ” he called. “See your traitor’s needle?

A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor’s face now.

The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit\r\ncontrolled atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul\r\ncould put there. Bene-Gesserit trained indeed, Paul thought.

Feyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in\r\na blur to his left hand. Paul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in Feyd-\r\nRautha’s thrust.

This is as true of humans in\r\nthe finite space of a planetary ecosystem as it is of gas\r\nmolecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how\r\nmany can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of\r\nexistence is possible for those who do survive. —Pardot Kynes, First Planetologist of Arrakis\r\nTHE EFFECT of Arrakis on the mind of the newcomer usually is that of\r\noverpowering barren land. The stranger might think nothing could live or\r\ngrow in the open here, that this was the true wasteland that had never been\r\nfertile and never would be. To Pardot Kynes, the planet was merely an expression of energy, a\r\nmachine being driven by its sun. What it needed was reshaping to fit it to\r\nman’s needs. His mind went directly to the free-moving human population,\r\nthe Fremen. What a challenge! What a tool they could be! Fremen: an\r\necological and geological force of almost unlimited potential. A direct and simple man in many ways, Pardot Kynes. One must evade\r\nHarkonnen restrictions? Excellent. Then one marries a Fremen woman. When\r\nshe gives you a Fremen son, you begin with him, with Liet-Kynes, and the\r\nother children, teaching them ecological literacy, creating a new language\r\nwith symbols that arm the mind to manipulate an entire landscape, its climate,\r\nseasonal limits, and finally to break through all ideas of force into the\r\ndazzling awareness of order. “There’s an internally recognized beauty of motion and balance on any\r\nman-healthy planet,” Kynes said. “You see in this beauty a dynamic\r\nstabilizing effect essential to all life. Its aim is simple: to maintain and\r\nproduce coordinated patterns of greater and greater diversity. Life improves\r\nthe closed system’s capacity to sustain life. Life—all life—is in the service of\r\nlife. Necessary nutrients are made available to life by life in greater and\r\ngreater richness as the diversity of life increases. The entire landscape comes\r\nalive, filled with relationships and relationships within relationships. ”\r\nThis was Pardot Kynes lecturing to a sietch warren class.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5ec03Q6EoH1r7sXt8TGZND/bE0F9b+5np8Q2uadbW5w="},"7009eb33-bb41-4eb3-a640-cfd918c95b84":{"id_":"7009eb33-bb41-4eb3-a640-cfd918c95b84","metadata":{"page_number":523,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_523","metadata":{"page_number":523,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"wRlMLPsiMT75LlJoMxzTQpdSWLBQ714zmJ/Wx6nnYeo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"98e02ab1-4e8c-4fd7-b05e-f0aa27ced359","metadata":{"page_number":523,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"zzAISSmmjBpjs9G2ZJdHI3v5Le4zkiu+uMkCsa+hxZs="}},"text":"Before the lectures, though, he had to convince the Fremen.

He was\r\nnot naive, he merely permitted himself no distractions. He was exploring the Arrakis landscape in a one-man groundcar one hot\r\nafternoon when he stumbled onto a deplorably common scene. Six\r\nHarkonnen bravos, shielded and fully armed, had trapped three Fremen\r\nyouths in the open behind the Shield Wall near the village of Windsack. To\r\nKynes, it was a ding-dong battle, more slapstick then real, until he focused on\r\nthe fact that the Harkonnens intended to kill the Fremen. By this time, one of\r\nthe youths was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down as\r\nwell, but it was still four armed men against two striplings. Kynes wasn’t brave; he merely had that single-mindedness and caution. The Harkonnens were killing Fremen. They were destroying the tools with\r\nwhich he intended to remake a planet! He triggered his own shield, waded in\r\nand had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip before they knew anyone\r\nwas behind them.

And save the lad he did... while the sixth Harkonnen was being dispatched. Now here was a pretty kettle of sandtrout! The Fremen didn’t know what\r\nto make of Kynes. They knew who he was, of course. No man arrived on\r\nArrakis without a full dossier finding its way into the Fremen strongholds. They knew him: he was an Imperial servant. But he killed Harkonnens! Adults might have shrugged and, with some regret, sent his shade to join\r\nthose of the six dead men on the ground.

Next, the nutrients: sand of Arrakis is\r\nmostly a product of worm digestion; dust (the truly omnipresent problem\r\nthere) is produced by the constant surface creep, the “saltation” movement of\r\nsand. Coarse grains are found on the downwind sides of dunes. The\r\nwindward side is packed smooth and hard. Old dunes are yellow (oxidized),\r\nyoung dunes are the color of the parent rock—usually gray. Downwind sides of old dunes provided the first plantation areas. The\r\nFremen aimed first for a cycle of poverty grass with peatlike hair cilia to\r\nintertwine, mat and fix the dunes by depriving the wind of its big weapon:\r\nmovable grains. Adaptive zones were laid out in the deep south far from Harkonnen\r\nwatchers. The mutated poverty grasses were planted first along the downwind\r\n(slipface) of the chosen dunes that stood across the path of the prevailing\r\nwesterlies. With the downwind face anchored, the windward face grew higher\r\nand higher and the grass was moved to keep pace. Giant sifs (long dunes with\r\nsinuous crest) of more than 1,500 meters height were produced this way.

A report came up from the palmaries:\r\nAt the desert edge of the plantings, the sand plankton is being poisoned\r\nthrough interaction with the new forms of life. The reason: protein\r\nincompatibility. Poisonous water was forming there which the Arrakis life\r\nwould not touch. A barren zone surrounded the plantings and even shai-hulud\r\nwould not invade it. Kynes went down to the palmaries himself—a twenty-thumper trip (in a\r\npalanquin like a wounded man or Reverend Mother because he never became\r\na sandrider). He tested the barren zone (it stank to heaven) and came up with\r\na bonus, a gift from Arrakis. The addition of sulfur and fixed nitrogen converted the barren zone to a\r\nrich plant bed for terraform life. The plantings could be advanced at will! “Does this change the timing? ” the Fremen asked. Kynes went back to his planetary formulae. Windtrap figures were fairly\r\nsecure by then. He was generous with his allowances, knowing he couldn’t\r\ndraw neat lines around ecological problems. A certain amount of plant cover\r\nhad to be set aside to hold dunes in place; a certain amount for foodstuffs\r\n(both human and animal); a certain amount to lock moisture in root systems\r\nand to feed water out into surrounding parched areas. They’d mapped the\r\nroving cold spots on the open bled by this time. These had to be figured into\r\nthe formulae. Even shai-hulud had a place in the charts. He must never be\r\ndestroyed, else spice wealth would end. But his inner digestive “factory,”\r\nwith its enormous concentrations of aldehydes and acids, was a giant source\r\nof oxygen.

The Imperial appointment\r\nfor which the elder Kynes already had applied in the name of his son was\r\ndelivered as a matter of course.

The ancient formulae intertwined, tangled together as they were fitted to\r\nthe needs of new conquests and new heraldic symbols. It was a time of\r\nstruggle between beast-demons on the one side and the old prayers and\r\ninvocations on the other. There was never a clear decision. During this period, it was said that Genesis was reinterpreted, permitting\r\nGod to say:\r\n“Increase and multiply, and fill the universe, and subdue it, and rule over\r\nall manner of strange beasts and living creatures in the infinite airs, on the\r\ninfinite earths and beneath them. ”\r\nIt was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real.

The god of\r\nmachine-logic was overthrown among the masses and a new concept was\r\nraised:\r\n“Man may not be replaced. ”\r\nThose two generations of violence were a thalamic pause for all\r\nhumankind.

Considering\r\nthe unrest of the time, this may not be an excessive estimate, although any\r\npretense to real accuracy in the figure must be just that—pretense. Communication between worlds was at one of its lowest ebbs. The troubadours, quite naturally, had a field day. A popular musical\r\ncomedy of the period had one of the C.E.T. delegates sitting on a white sand\r\nbeach beneath a palm tree singing:\r\n“For God, woman and the splendor of love \r\nWe dally here sans fears or cares.

The major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild, the\r\nBene Gesserit and the Landsraad, which continued its 2,000-year record of\r\nmeeting in spite of the severest obstacles. The Guild’s part appears clear: they\r\ngave free transport for all Landsraad and C.E.T. business. The Bene Gesserit\r\nrole is more obscure.

The Bene Gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person they\r\nlabeled “Kwisatz Haderach,” a term signifying “one who can be many places\r\nat once. ” In simpler terms, what they sought was a human with mental\r\npowers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions.

The\r\nProphet’s mother, Lady Jessica, was a natural daughter of the Baron Vladimir\r\nHarkonnen and carried gene-markers whose supreme importance to the\r\nbreeding program was known for almost two thousand years. She was a Bene\r\nGesserit bred and trained, and should have been a willing tool of the project. The Lady Jessica was ordered to produce an Atreides daughter.

Instead, for reasons she confesses have never been completely clear to\r\nher, the concubine Lady Jessica defied her orders and bore a son. This alone should have alerted the Bene Gesserit to the possibility that a\r\nwild variable had entered their scheme. But there were other far more\r\nimportant indications that they virtually ignored:\r\n1. As a youth, Paul Atreides showed ability to predict the\r\nfuture.

He was a\r\nmagnificent human being, a man of great honor and distinction, and the most\r\ninteresting person at any gathering, drawing listeners around him like a\r\nmagnet. To say he was an intellectual giant would be an understatement,\r\nsince he seemed to contain all of the knowledge of the universe in his\r\nmarvelous mind. He was my father, and I loved him deeply. Nonetheless, a son’s journey to understand the legendary author was not\r\nalways a smooth one, as I described in my biography of him, Dreamer of\r\nDune. Growing up in Frank Herbert’s household, I did not understand his\r\nneed for absolute silence so that he could concentrate, the intense desire he\r\nhad to complete his important writing projects, or the confidence he had that\r\none day his writing would be a success, despite the steady stream of\r\nrejections that he received. To my young eyes, the characters he created in\r\nDune and his other stories were the children of his mind, and they competed\r\nwith me for his affections. In the years it took him to write his magnum opus,\r\nhe spent more time with Paul Atreides than he did with me. Dad’s study was\r\noff-limits to me, to my sister Penny, and to my brother Bruce. In those days,\r\nonly my mother Beverly really understood Dad’s complexities. Ultimately, it\r\nwas through her love for him, and the love he gave back to her, that I came to\r\nsee the nurturing, loving side of the man. By that time I was in my mid-twenties, having rebelled against his exacting\r\nways for years. When I finally saw the soul of my father and began to\r\nappreciate him for the care he gave my mother when she was terminally ill,\r\nhe and I became the best of friends. He helped me with my own writing\r\ncareer by showing me what editors wanted to see in books; he taught me how\r\nto construct interesting characters, how to build suspense, how to keep\r\nreaders turning the pages. After perusing an early draft of Sidney’s Comet\r\n(which would become my first published novel), he marked up several pages\r\nand then wrote me this note: “These pages ... show how editing tightens the\r\nstory.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bJh2Kv6FvGkeJeod0jI4egcQdnL3gDr5Ch+5xSSWLpk="},"741252a0-d074-478d-868a-da8eabab8776":{"id_":"741252a0-d074-478d-868a-da8eabab8776","metadata":{"page_number":569,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_569","metadata":{"page_number":569,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"kPqkxYmy1UVGIkiv89EHC3QaY4Zk8Eb3xuXUAfSeBf8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d3d9ea90-e399-4d86-b58c-d7715d975d22","metadata":{"page_number":569,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"bJh2Kv6FvGkeJeod0jI4egcQdnL3gDr5Ch+5xSSWLpk="}},"text":"show how editing tightens the\r\nstory.

Earlier in Dune, Frank\r\nHerbert had modeled Lady Jessica Atreides after Beverly Herbert, with her\r\ndignified, gentle ways of influence, and even her prescient abilities, which\r\nmy mother actually possessed. He also wrote of “Lady Jessica’s latent\r\n(prophetic) abilities,” and in this he was describing my mother, thinking of all\r\nthe amazing paranormal feats she had accomplished in her lifetime. In an\r\nendearing tone, he often referred to her as his “white witch,” or good witch. Similarly, throughout the Dune series, he described the heroic Ben Gesserit\r\nwomen as “witches. ”\r\nDune is the most admired science fiction novel ever written and has sold\r\ntens of millions of copies all over the world, in more than twenty languages. It is to science fiction what the Lord of the Rings trilogy is to fantasy, the\r\nmost highly regarded, respected works in their respective genres. Of course,\r\nDune is not just science fiction. It includes strong elements of fantasy and\r\ncontains so many important layers beneath the story line that it has become a\r\nmainstream classic. As one dimension of this, just look at the cover on the\r\nbook in your hands, the quiet dignity expressed in the artwork. The novel was first published in hardcover in 1965 by Chilton Books, best\r\nknown for their immense auto-repair novels. No other publisher would touch\r\nthe book, in part because of the length of the manuscript. They felt it was far\r\ntoo long at 215,000 words, when most novels of the day were only a quarter\r\nto a third that length. Dune would require immense printing costs and a high\r\nhardcover price for the time, in excess of five dollars. No science fiction\r\nnovel had ever commanded a retail price that high. Publishers also expressed concern about the complexity of the novel and\r\nall of the new, exotic words that the author introduced in the beginning,\r\nwhich tended to slow the story down. One editor said that he could not get\r\nthrough the first hundred pages without becoming confused and irritated. Another said that he might be making a huge mistake in turning the book\r\ndown, but he did so anyway.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hB/TMbEv+p9bwF3ORkNQ8025jul08SAsgSD0iUB3Qgk="},"9ff9ebe7-2421-489a-9dc3-4d67b87b6335":{"id_":"9ff9ebe7-2421-489a-9dc3-4d67b87b6335","metadata":{"page_number":570,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_570","metadata":{"page_number":570,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"JID2WmJAWEkZ8Gp3Gjd2X3f6AhVUfIAYW7qHK/+EqkY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b4fae90f-e564-4fee-9752-358d7e37fbae","metadata":{"page_number":570,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"hB/TMbEv+p9bwF3ORkNQ8025jul08SAsgSD0iUB3Qgk="}},"text":"Initial sales of the book were slow, but Frank Herbert’s science fiction—\r\nwriting peers and readers recognized the genius of the work from the\r\nbeginning, awarding it the coveted Nebula and Hugo awards for best novel of\r\nthe year.

Many fans didn’t understand this message,\r\nbecause they didn’t want to see their superhero brought down from his\r\npedestal. Still, the book sold well, and so did its predecessor. Looking back at\r\nDune, it is clear that Dad laid the seeds of the troublesome direction he\r\nintended to take with his hero, but a lot of readers didn’t want to see it. John\r\nW. Campbell, the editor of Analog who made many useful suggestions when\r\nDune was being serialized, did not like Dune Messiah because of this Paul\r\nAtreides issue. Having studied politics carefully, my father believed that heroes made\r\nmistakes ... mistakes that were simplified by the number of people who\r\nfollowed such leaders slavishly. In a foreshadowing epigraph, Frank Herbert\r\nwrote in Dune: “Remember, we speak now of the Muad‘Dib who ordered\r\nbattle drums made from his enemies’ skins, the Muad’Dib who denied the\r\nconventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: ‘I am\r\nthe Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough. ’ ” And in a dramatic scene, as\r\nLiet-Kynes lay dying in the desert, he remembered the long-ago words of his\r\nown father: “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them\r\nto fall into the hands of a Hero. ”\r\nBy the early 1970s, sales of Dune began to accelerate, largely because the\r\nnovel was heralded as an environmental handbook, warning about the\r\ndangers of destroying the Earth’s finite resources. Frank Herbert spoke to\r\nmore than 30,000 people at the first Earth Day in Philadelphia, and he toured\r\nthe country, speaking to enthusiastic college audiences. The environmental\r\nmovement was sweeping the nation, and Dad rode the crest of the wave, a\r\nbreathtaking trip. When he published Children of Dune in 1976, it became a\r\nrunaway bestseller, hitting every important list in the country. Children of Dune was the first science fiction novel to become a New York\r\nTimes bestseller in both hardcover and paperback, and sales reached into the\r\nmillions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"URkVRlaKJbLznEUdy6UFRxetPcqB7vX37UPR/vmMUgM="},"9bf36d4b-3e30-44da-a969-1f60bd96e9df":{"id_":"9bf36d4b-3e30-44da-a969-1f60bd96e9df","metadata":{"page_number":571,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_571","metadata":{"page_number":571,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"UCKA5ER9RzgjU4VlcvJofbeSm3EmHrsYBl6KTipvwDY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0219f6f9-673a-4483-b591-ef938580262b","metadata":{"page_number":571,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"URkVRlaKJbLznEUdy6UFRxetPcqB7vX37UPR/vmMUgM="}},"text":"After that, other science fiction writers began to have their own\r\nbest-sellers, but Frank Herbert was the first to obtain such a high level of\r\nreadership; he brought science fiction out of the ghetto of literature.

He intended to call the article “They Stopped the\r\nMoving Sands,” but soon realized that he had a much bigger story on his\r\nhands. Frank Herbert’s life experiences are layered into the pages of the Dune\r\nseries, combined with an eclectic assortment of fascinating ideas that sprang\r\nfrom his researches. Among other things, the Dune universe is a spiritual\r\nmelting pot, a far future in which religious beliefs have combined into\r\ninteresting forms. Discerning readers will recognize Buddhism, Sufi\r\nMysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism,\r\nJudaism, and Hinduism. In the San Francisco Bay Area, my father even knew\r\nZen Master Alan Watts, who lived on an old ferryboat. Dad drew on a variety\r\nof religious influences, without adhering to any one of them. Consistent with\r\nthis, the stated purpose of the Commission of Ecumenical Translators, as\r\ndescribed in an appendix to Dune, was to eliminate arguments between\r\nreligions, each of which claimed to have “the one and only revelation. ”\r\nWhen he was a boy, eight of Dad’s Irish Catholic aunts tried to force\r\nCatholicism on him, but he resisted. Instead, this became the genesis of the\r\nBene Gesserit Sisterhood. This fictional organization would claim it did not\r\nbelieve in organized religion, but the sisters were spiritual nonetheless. Both\r\nmy father and mother were like that as well. During the 1950s, Frank Herbert was a political speechwriter and publicity\r\nwriter for U.S. senatorial and congressional candidates. In that decade, he\r\nalso journeyed twice to Mexico with his family, where he studied desert\r\nconditions and crop cycles, and was subjected unwittingly to the effects of a\r\nhallucinogenic drug. All of those experiences, and a great deal from his\r\nchildhood, found their way onto the pages of Dune.

For the names of heroes, Frank Herbert selected from Greek mythology\r\nand other mythological bases. The Greek House Atreus, upon which House\r\nAtreides in Dune was based, was the ill-fated family of kings Menelaus and\r\nAgamemnon. A heroic family, it was beset by tragic flaws and burdened with\r\na curse pronounced against it by Thyestes. This foreshadows the troubles\r\nFrank Herbert had in mind for the Atreides family. The evil Harkonnens of\r\nDune are related to the Atreides by blood, so when they assassinate Paul’s\r\nfather Duke Leto, it is kinsmen against kinsmen, similar to what occurred in\r\nthe household of Agamemnon when he was murdered by his wife\r\nClytemnestra. Dune is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which\r\ngreat sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that\r\nrepresents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis\r\nfeatures immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with “great\r\nteeth” and a “bellows breath of cinnamon. ” This resembles the myth\r\ndescribed by an unknown English poet in Beowulf, the compelling tale of a\r\nfearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs,\r\nat the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with\r\ngiant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of\r\nShai-Hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful\r\nsandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to\r\nemanate from the Maker (Shai-Hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on\r\nEarth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew\r\nparallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions\r\ninto world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush.

One time I asked my father if he identified with any of the characters in his\r\nstories, and to my surprise he said it was Stilgar, the rugged leader of the\r\nFremen. I had been thinking of Dad more as the dignified, honorable Duke\r\nLeto, or the heroic, swashbuckling Paul, or the loyal Duncan Idaho. Mulling\r\nthis over, I realized Stilgar was the equivalent of a Native American chief in\r\nDune—a person who represented and defended time-honored ways that did\r\nnot harm the ecology of the planet. Frank Herbert was that, and a great deal\r\nmore. As a child, he had known a Native American who hinted that he had\r\nbeen banished from his tribe, a man named Indian Henry who taught my\r\nfather some of the ways of his people, including fishing, the identification of\r\nedible and medicinal plants in the forest, and how to find red ants and\r\nprotein-rich grub worms for food. When he set up the desert planet of Arrakis and the galactic empire\r\nencompassing it, Frank Herbert pitted western culture against primitive\r\nculture and gave the nod to the latter. In Dune he wrote, “Polish comes from\r\nthe cities; wisdom from the desert. ” (Later, in his mainstream novel Soul\r\nCatcher, he would do something similar and would favor old ways over\r\nmodern ways). Like the nomadic Bedouins of the Arabian plateau, the\r\nFremen live an admirable, isolated existence, separated from civilization by\r\nvast stretches of desert. The Fremen take psychedelic drugs during religious\r\nrites, like the Navajo Indians of North America. And like the Jews, the\r\nFremen have been persecuted, driven to hide from authorities and survive\r\naway from their homeland. Both Jews and Fremen expect to be led to the\r\npromised land by a messiah. The words and names in Dune are from many tongues, including Navajo,\r\nLatin, Chakobsa (a language found in the Caucasus), the Nahuatl dialect of\r\nthe Aztecs, Greek, Persian, East Indian, Russian, Turkish, Finnish, Old\r\nEnglish, and, of course, Arabic.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2Qfw3Yi1Y1Aw172Dlmv5Fr6kd2Ro3M60MvNGGIz6i/4="},"972b9bc7-5ee9-4ee2-b4a1-f726f465ffb1":{"id_":"972b9bc7-5ee9-4ee2-b4a1-f726f465ffb1","metadata":{"page_number":574,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf_574","metadata":{"page_number":574,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"boaUxAx0lujk1h6B6K/NE9JjcIPiPw47fo8MFB17F0M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"133b39c4-59d5-48a2-a2b9-2fef8ab2cd6e","metadata":{"page_number":574,"file_path":"/Users/terezatizkova/Developer/e2b-cookbook/examples/llamaindex/llamaindex-1/data/Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf","file_name":"Dune by Frank Herbert.pdf"},"hash":"2Qfw3Yi1Y1Aw172Dlmv5Fr6kd2Ro3M60MvNGGIz6i/4="}},"text":"In Children of Dune, Leto II allowed sandtrout to attach themselves to his\r\nbody, and this was based in part upon my father’s own experiences as a boy\r\ngrowing up in Washington State, when he rolled up his trousers and waded\r\ninto a stream or lake, permitting leeches to attach themselves to his legs.

The Butlerian Jihad, occurring ten thousand years before the events\r\ndescribed in Dune was a war against thinking machines who at one time had\r\ncruelly enslaved humans. For this reason, computers were eventually made\r\nillegal by humans, as decreed in the Orange Catholic Bible: “Thou shalt not\r\nmake a machine in the likeness of a human mind. ” The roots of the jihad\r\nwent back to individuals my parents knew, to my mother’s grandfather\r\nCooper Landis and to our family friend Ralph Slattery, both of whom\r\nabhorred machines. Still, there are computers in the Dune universe, long after the jihad.

The age of Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV is slightly inconsistent\r\nin the novel, but it is one of the few glitches in the entire Dune series.

A neat\r\ntrick, and he pulled it off perfectly. As his eldest son, I see familial influences in the story. Earlier, I noted that\r\nmy mother is memorialized in Dune and so is Dad. He must have been\r\nthinking of himself when he wrote that Duke Leto’s “qualities as a father\r\nhave long been overlooked. ” The words have deep significance to me,\r\nbecause at the time he and I were not getting along well at all. I was going\r\nthrough a rebellious teenage phase, reacting to the uncompromising manner\r\nin which he ruled the household. At the beginning of Dune, Paul Atreides is fifteen years old, around the\r\nsame age I was at the time the book was first serialized in Analog. I do not\r\nsee myself much in the characterization of Paul, but I do see Dad in Paul’s\r\nfather, the noble Duke Leto Atreides. In one passage, Frank Herbert wrote:\r\n“Yet many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene\r\nGesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son ... ” Late in his life, Dad\r\nresponded to interview questions about my own writing career by saying,\r\n“The acorn doesn’t fall far from the oak tree. ” He often complimented me to\r\nothers, more than he did to me directly. To most of his friends he seemed like\r\nan extrovert, but in family matters he was often quite the opposite, preferring\r\nto retire to his study. Frequently, his strongest emotions went on the page, so\r\nI often feel him speaking to me as I read his stories. Once, I asked my father if he thought his magnum opus would endure. He\r\nsaid modestly that he didn’t know and that the only valid literary critic was\r\ntime. Now it has been forty years since Dune was published in hardcover, and\r\nFrank Herbert would be pleased to know that interest in his fantastic novel,\r\nand the series it spawned, has never waned. An entire new generation of\r\nreaders is picking up Dune and enjoying it, just as their parents did before\r\nthem.
